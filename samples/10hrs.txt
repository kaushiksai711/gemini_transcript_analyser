00:00:01.710 From professional curling stoneshoned in Scotland
00:00:05.213 to Japanese calligraphy ink
00:00:07.340 kneaded by foot and hand,
00:00:10.969 we've investigated countless luxury
00:00:13.263 products from every corner of the world.
00:00:16.683 To celebrate 10 seasons of "So Expensive,"
00:00:19.644 sit back and enjoy this 10-hour marathon.
00:00:25.316 First up: lotus silk,
00:00:27.527 extracted by hand, one stem at a time.
00:00:33.533 Lotus silk is one of the rarest fabrics
00:00:35.660 in the world,
00:00:36.911 produced only in small scaleacross Cambodia, Myanmar,
00:00:40.415 and, more recently, Vietnam.
00:00:42.125 This natural fiber is only extracted
00:00:44.419 by a few skilled craftspeopleacross the world.
00:00:47.756 But making this silk isn't easy.
00:00:50.675 Extracting enough lotus silk for one scarf
00:00:53.011 can take two months,
00:00:54.596 and the final productcan cost 10 times as much
00:00:57.015 as regular silk.
00:00:58.349 So just how is it made,
00:01:00.060 and what makes it so expensive?
00:01:06.649 Phan Thi Thuan's familyhave been making silk
00:01:08.860 for generations, growingand harvesting the threads
00:01:11.863 from silkworms themselvesto create luxury garments.
00:01:15.492 But making lotus silk is different.
00:01:18.453 Silk usually comes from silkworms.
00:01:20.872 They're kept on wide trays
00:01:22.373 and need to be fed almost 24 hours a day
00:01:24.793 with mulberry leaves.
00:01:26.336 The caterpillars delicately spin threads
00:01:28.296 to create their cocoons,
00:01:29.798 and it can take hundreds of silkworms
00:01:31.424 to make a kilo of silk.
00:01:33.426 But while the insects requirecareful looking after,
00:01:36.054 they do most of the hard work themselves.
00:01:38.389 The key difference betweenthe bright yellow silk
00:01:40.642 and the paler lotus version
00:01:42.519 is that every single strand of lotus silk
00:01:44.813 must be extracted by hand.
00:02:15.802 Narrator: Each thread oflotus silk starts with
00:02:17.512 the stem of the lotus flower.
00:02:20.140 The lotus is Vietnam's national flower
00:02:22.350 and a plant that's grownacross the country.
00:02:25.019 While this fabric has beenmade for years in Myanmar,
00:02:27.939 Phan Thi Thuan only started experimenting
00:02:30.024 with this fiber in 2017.
00:02:58.970 Narrator: Once the stem isselected and picked by hand,
00:03:01.472 the silk inside can be extracted.
00:03:03.725 Each stem contains a minuscule amount
00:03:05.727 of thin, sticky fibers,
00:03:07.187 which must be rolled together and dried.
00:03:09.981 The threads need to beprocessed within 24 hours
00:03:12.442 while they're still wet;otherwise, they'll break.
00:03:15.278 And so harvesting has to be done each day.
00:03:18.239 And the lotus plants areonly available to harvest
00:03:20.491 between April and October.
00:03:23.578 Once you've gone through the hard work
00:03:24.829 of extracting these fibers,
00:03:26.247 they're incredibly delicate, too.
00:04:25.723 Narrator: Once dry, thesethreads are carefully
00:04:27.350 weighed down and delicately hand-spooled.
00:04:29.894 Then they're put into the loom.
00:04:31.980 These fibers are fragile, but once woven,
00:04:34.190 can be as durable as traditional silk.
00:04:37.360 Phan has a team of 20 workers
00:04:39.070 creating these fibers each day,
00:04:40.989 allowing them to produce 10to 20 scarves each month.
00:04:44.325 But when a 25-centimeter scarf
00:04:46.244 can sell for just over $200,
00:04:48.454 the hard work is worth it.
00:04:50.665 The final product isunlike any other fiber.
00:04:52.917 It's soft like silk,breathable like linen,
00:04:55.253 and slightly elastic.
00:04:57.088 These luxurious traits havemade it popular with tourists
00:04:59.674 searching for rare souvenirs.
00:05:01.592 It's also recently been picked up
00:05:03.052 by international fashion brands
00:05:04.554 searching for new luxury fiber.
00:05:07.015 But its scale has been limited,
00:05:08.558 as there are still few trained
00:05:09.934 in the making of these silk threads.
00:05:12.603 But despite the work involved,
00:05:14.063 Phan Thi Thuan is hoping that this skill
00:05:16.691 could one day grow tobecome a larger industry.
00:06:03.696 Narrator: Japanese chef'sknives are world-renowned
00:06:05.698 for their unique design and durability.
00:06:08.910 And just one can cost you over $900.
00:06:13.247 From heating and hammering the metal
00:06:18.211 to sharpening the knife's edge
00:06:19.962 and polishing the final blade,
00:06:22.632 these are only a few of the skills
00:06:24.759 a Japanese artisan spends alifetime learning to master.
00:06:29.180 So what makes these knives so coveted?
00:06:32.016 And why are they so expensive?
00:06:58.543 Narrator: Terukazu has spent37 years crafting chef's knives
00:07:01.796 at his family's factory in Echizen.
00:07:05.216 Each one goes through100 production stages.
00:07:09.053 It's a process that requiresover 10 years of practice.
00:07:40.626 Narrator: Compared to popularEuropean chef's knives,
00:07:43.129 Japanese blades are lighter and sharper,
00:07:45.882 allowing for more precise cuts.
00:07:48.468 On the low end,
00:07:49.385 most Takamura blades costa couple hundred dollars.
00:07:52.722 But custom-made pieces cansell for 15 times that.
00:07:56.476 One of the most expensiveknives produced by the shop
00:07:59.020 sold for $6,900.
00:08:29.550 Narrator: Takamura Hamono wasone of the first knife makers
00:08:32.178 to use a certain kind of stainless steel
00:08:34.847 called high-speed powdered steel.
00:08:37.099 It was originallydesigned for power tools,
00:08:39.644 like saws and drills,
00:08:41.102 because of its durability and strength --
00:08:43.397 two qualities Japanese chef'sknives are known for today.
00:08:51.489 Once the metal is cut,
00:08:52.823 it's heated in an electric oven
00:08:54.700 to harden and strengthen the blade.
00:08:57.453 Then the hammering begins.
00:09:01.332 At this point, the artisanrelies on experience
00:09:04.001 and instinct to guidethem in producing a blade
00:09:06.504 of ideal strength and thinness.
00:09:10.299 Hammering leaves behind circular indents,
00:09:13.052 something knife makers in thepast typically polished away.
00:09:16.681 But 60 years ago,
00:09:17.932 Terakuzu's father and his colleagues
00:09:19.934 discovered the benefit of knives
00:09:21.561 with a textured surface, like this.
00:09:53.926 Narrator: This hammeredfinish, called tsuchime,
00:09:56.345 allowed chefs to chop ingredients quickly
00:09:58.723 and more efficiently.
00:10:00.600 It also added a beautifulaesthetic to each blade,
00:10:04.020 another element highlyvalued in Japanese knives.
00:10:14.113 Narrator: But a Japanesechef's knife wouldn't be
00:10:15.906 nearly as valuable withoutits supremely sharp edge.
00:10:20.661 An artisan presses the bladeagainst a rough grindstone
00:10:23.372 made of natural rock,
00:10:24.999 a sharpening material you'llonly see used in Japan.
00:10:28.753 This step distinguishes an artisan's skill
00:10:31.672 and ultimately sets a knife's final value.
00:11:05.247 Narrator: It takes one fullday to sharpen the blade
00:11:07.750 and another full day tosecure and polish the handle.
00:11:14.840 The final knife is totally unique --
00:11:17.551 each with its own distinct balance,
00:11:19.387 thickness, and design.
00:11:57.883 Narrator: Several ofthe world's best chefs
00:11:59.385 use Takamura's knives,
00:12:01.011 from René Redzepi at Noma
00:12:03.222 to Massimo Bottura at Osteria Francescana.
00:12:06.726 Another one of thosechefs is Masakazu Fujii.
00:12:10.229 He uses Takamura's knives to prepare fish
00:12:12.690 at his restaurant in Fukui.
00:13:09.455 Narrator: Echizen has been the center
00:13:10.831 of high-quality-knife making
00:13:12.708 since blacksmiths begancrafting chef's knives here
00:13:15.211 700 years ago.
00:13:17.546 And today, the city isinternationally recognized
00:13:19.882 for its cutlery production.
00:13:22.510 But before knives, artisans made swords --
00:13:25.596 another valuable tradein Japanese culture.
00:14:00.130 Narrator: Despite dedicatingdecades to this craft,
00:14:03.133 Terukazu and his brothersweren't always set on
00:14:05.594 becoming master knife makers.
00:15:01.817 Narrator: Professional chef or not,
00:15:03.819 getting your hands onone of Takamura's knives
00:15:06.071 could take years.
00:15:07.698 With that kind of wait time,
00:15:09.283 coupled with the decades of training
00:15:10.910 required to master this craft,
00:15:13.078 it's likely these pieceswill remain costly
00:15:15.372 for years to come.
00:15:51.367 Narrator: With everyshaving and small incision,
00:15:54.662 master artisans turn these trunks of wood
00:15:57.539 into 32 hand-carved chess pieces.
00:16:00.709 You can pick up a plastic set for $20,
00:16:04.004 but a wooden set certified
00:16:05.673 for the World ChessChampionship costs $500.
00:16:09.843 Much of the value of a high-quality set
00:16:12.096 comes down to how welljust one piece is made:
00:16:16.308 the knight.
00:16:17.851 There are less than 10 people
00:16:19.269 who are trusted to carve the knights
00:16:21.021 for the official WorldChess Championship sets.
00:16:24.441 So, how are these chessmen made?
00:16:27.069 And why are they so expensive?
00:16:33.575 At this factory in Amritsar, India,
00:16:35.703 artisans carve the pieces
00:16:37.162 for the official WorldChess Championship sets.
00:16:40.666 And the factory producesonly 250 of them each year.
00:16:45.879 Artisans train over four to five months,
00:16:48.215 learning to masterfully shape each figure.
00:16:51.969 These small blocks of boxwoodwere once large trunks,
00:16:55.514 dried for three to six months, cut down,
00:16:58.142 and shaped to the necessary size.
00:17:01.353 Each block is attached to a lathe,
00:17:03.355 which turns the block rapidly
00:17:04.732 before artisans begin to carve.
00:17:09.486 Artisans use particularsteel tools, called cutters,
00:17:13.406 designed to make the proper cuts
00:17:15.159 and overall shape of a chessman.
00:17:17.994 Once the cutter makes contact,
00:17:19.747 it immediately changes the wood,
00:17:22.249 and any slight misstep
00:17:23.666 could ruin the final shape of the piece.
00:17:27.713 No piece is more difficultto produce than the knight.
00:17:31.884 While other pieces arecarved in just a few minutes,
00:17:35.179 a single knight takestwo hours to produce.
00:17:41.560 Less than 10 people aretrained to craft knights
00:17:44.104 for these championship sets.
00:17:57.576 Narrator: Compare that tothe four to five months
00:17:59.703 it takes an artisan to learn how to carve
00:18:01.830 the other chess pieces.
00:18:04.458 But unlike these other chessmen,
00:18:06.210 the knight isn't anabstract representation
00:18:09.046 of a medieval figure.
00:18:11.131 It's designed to look likea realistic horse head.
00:18:15.052 It's the most detailed of all the pieces.
00:18:18.639 Each carving is intentional,
00:18:20.724 from the hair on a knight's tail
00:18:23.018 to the curve of its neck.
00:18:35.155 Narrator: The quality of the final piece
00:18:37.324 largely depends on theskill of the artisan.
00:18:40.786 A top-quality knight mustbe completely symmetrical.
00:18:58.303 Narrator: But it's just as important
00:18:59.930 that all four knights in theset look totally uniform.
00:19:03.892 Otherwise, the set altogether
00:19:06.019 won't be nearly as valuable.
00:19:08.313 According to The House of Staunton,
00:19:09.982 a large manufacturer of chess sets,
00:19:12.568 a set of finely carvedknights can represent
00:19:15.404 up to 50% of the totalcost of the chessmen.
00:19:19.408 The other chessmen have specific height
00:19:21.618 and width requirements
00:19:23.120 designed by architect Daniel Weil.
00:19:25.956 The king must be thetallest, at 95 millimeters,
00:19:29.334 and have a base that's39 millimeters wide,
00:19:32.296 the largest of them all.
00:19:34.548 The pieces have defining characteristics,
00:19:37.176 like the king's crown or the refined jewel
00:19:40.012 at the top of the queen's coronet.
00:19:42.598 These distinct features require more time
00:19:45.184 and effort for the carver.
00:19:47.519 The king's crown in a championship set
00:19:49.521 should have eight small cuts
00:19:51.315 and be slightly rounded along the edges.
00:19:54.109 Compare this king to theking of a regular set,
00:19:57.070 which has a much simplerstraight-edge design.
00:20:00.240 Pieces with even simplerdesigns than that, like a rook,
00:20:03.827 take these artisans seventimes longer to produce
00:20:06.830 compared to regular chess sets.
00:20:09.082 Aditya Chopra: If the chessmanis of a championship set,
00:20:11.710 then we are only able tomake 25 to 30 kings in a day
00:20:16.298 because it's a very special design.
00:20:18.342 If we're talking about
00:20:20.052 making chessmen for tournament players,
00:20:22.179 which are used in vast quantities,
00:20:24.056 then a carver is even able to make
00:20:25.724 200 to 250 chess kings in a day.
00:20:29.269 Narrator: But the designof these chess pieces
00:20:31.104 isn't solely aesthetic.
00:20:33.398 It can actually affectthe outcome of a game.
00:20:36.526 Each piece must be the correct height:
00:20:38.779 the king being the tallest,followed by the queen,
00:20:41.615 bishop, knight, rook, and pawn.
00:20:44.826 The detailed features are also essential,
00:20:47.579 by lowering the chances aplayer will make a mistake.
00:20:51.375 Chopra: If you see in the Medieval Ages,
00:20:53.460 the chessmen were notreally in a good form.
00:20:57.464 The chessmen were round;some of them were spiral.
00:21:01.134 The knights were not evencarved in the shape of a knight.
00:21:04.680 In this form, you cansee the kings properly,
00:21:07.057 the knight, very distinguished.
00:21:09.059 The bishop has a miter cut;
00:21:10.894 the queen is very sharp.
00:21:13.188 So you can easily distinguishbetween all the six pieces.
00:21:16.817 Narrator: This is knownas the Staunton design,
00:21:18.902 the only style allowed ininternational competition today.
00:21:23.740 Pieces used in the championship match
00:21:25.701 have an electroniccoil, making it possible
00:21:28.453 to track and broadcast each player's move.
00:21:31.373 A full set with this tracking component
00:21:33.667 costs about $700 more.
00:21:36.670 The weight of each piecealong with the felt bottom
00:21:39.464 are two more significantfactors that affect the game.
00:21:42.968 Both make the chessmen easier to use,
00:21:45.679 effectively upping their value.
00:21:48.348 Chopra: If the piecesare properly weighted,
00:21:50.267 then they do not fall
00:21:51.768 while you're moving thepieces on the board.
00:21:53.979 And it also gives a very nice
00:21:56.273 and a special feel to a chessman.
00:22:00.610 Narrator: Some chessmen must be dyed black
00:22:02.571 and dried for 10 days.
00:22:04.948 All of the pieces are buffedand polished three times
00:22:08.368 before they're assessed for quality.
00:22:13.415 Chess has been playedfor over 1,000 years,
00:22:16.501 with some form of the game first appearing
00:22:18.587 in India around the 6th century.
00:22:21.423 Over the past two centuries,
00:22:23.091 high-level competitions have drawn
00:22:25.052 international interest in the game.
00:22:27.846 Today, tournaments continueto keep the game popular,
00:22:31.516 as do displays of thesecompetitions in the media.
00:22:35.145 The release of the limitedseries "The Queen's Gambit"
00:22:37.606 on Netflix sent sales ofchess sets skyrocketing
00:22:40.650 in November 2020.
00:22:43.195 And although this demand isa positive for the industry,
00:22:46.406 it also poses a challenge tochess producers like Aditya.
00:22:50.869 Chopra: It is very difficultto find good-quality,
00:22:53.080 skilled carvers formanufacturing chessmen.
00:22:55.415 And even after four tofive months, six months,
00:22:58.043 we don't know if thecarver will be good enough
00:23:00.670 to carve nice chessmen.
00:23:02.756 So nobody wants to spend so much time
00:23:05.675 and realize that he was not able
00:23:07.260 to carve the desired quality of chessmen.
00:23:11.139 Narrator: Without enoughexperienced carvers,
00:23:13.558 these sets could becomemore difficult to produce.
00:23:17.104 And it's fair to expectthat $500 sets like these
00:23:20.941 and similarly hand-carved ones
00:23:23.360 could get even pricier in the future.
00:23:26.613 Narrator: This is ink.
00:23:28.615 Toshitsugu Okabe is kneading it
00:23:30.784 until it's as soft as a rice cake.
00:23:33.912 It's imperative for him tobe as thorough as possible,
00:23:37.165 because a well-kneaded mixture
00:23:38.834 becomes high-quality calligraphy ink.
00:23:42.045 It takes at least four years of aging
00:23:44.756 before these solid ink sticks can be sold,
00:23:47.467 and even longer for themost expensive ones.
00:23:50.637 A 200-gram high-grade inkstick from this producer,
00:23:54.099 Kobaien, costs over $1,000.
00:23:57.519 And for some other brands,
00:23:59.354 prices can reach almost $2,000.
00:24:02.858 Meanwhile, almost double the amount
00:24:04.901 of commercial liquid Indiaink can go for less than $9.
00:24:09.072 So, why are solid inksticks so sought after?
00:24:12.367 And why are they so expensive?
00:24:17.581 It's January in Japan's Nara Prefecture.
00:24:21.126 Ink producer Kobaien has been making
00:24:23.295 Japanese calligraphy ink for 450 years.
00:24:27.757 This type of ink, also known as sumi,
00:24:31.386 is traditionally sold in the form
00:24:33.013 of handmade solid ink sticks.
00:24:36.141 To use the dry ink stick,
00:24:37.893 calligraphers rub it on an inkstone to mix it with water.
00:24:42.063 Sumi ink is typically black,
00:24:44.149 but it can also be tinted brown or blue.
00:24:47.569 The ingredients are simple:
00:24:49.613 soot, animal glue, and perfume.
00:24:53.450 But the quality of these materials
00:24:55.619 and the time-intensive techniques
00:24:57.120 required to collect and process them
00:24:59.372 have a large impact on the final price.
00:25:05.170 It starts in this room,lit by 100 oil lamps.
00:25:10.175 This workshop has four rooms like this,
00:25:12.636 where artisans produce all the soot
00:25:14.471 they require to make ink.
00:25:16.848 Two workers are in charge of this stage,
00:25:19.267 each overseeing tworooms and 200 oil lamps.
00:25:23.897 They carefully manage thevegetable oil in the lamps
00:25:26.900 and gradually collectsoot throughout the day.
00:25:30.237 In Japan, this process iscalled "catching smoke."
00:25:36.493 Every day, artisans light all 400 lamps
00:25:39.871 and cover each with a lid,
00:25:41.748 the underside of whichcollects soot as the oil burns.
00:25:45.752 But they can't just leave the lid
00:25:47.254 in the same place for hours,
00:25:49.172 because overheating it willprevent soot from accumulating.
00:25:53.468 The flame must be off-center,
00:25:55.512 and the artisans must rotate the lid
00:25:57.180 every 20 minutes for two hours.
00:26:01.393 The artisans scrape thesoot off the top of the lid.
00:26:04.729 They replenish the oil, andthe process starts all over,
00:26:08.650 for a total of five timesa day for each lamp.
00:26:12.946 These lamps contain rapeseed oil,
00:26:15.282 the most common choice whenproducing high-grade ink sticks.
00:26:19.369 Ink sticks made of soot fromeven more expensive oils,
00:26:22.455 like paulownia, camellia, or sesame,
00:26:25.542 can easily cost up to four times as much.
00:26:29.963 But artisans must alsoconsider other details,
00:26:32.841 like the containers that hold the oil
00:26:35.176 and the material of the wick.
00:26:38.138 To ensure the quality of the soot,
00:26:40.140 they use nonporous earthenware containers.
00:26:43.560 Craftspeople in this workshop even weave
00:26:46.021 the wicks themselves toexacting specifications.
00:27:23.642 Narrator: The fineness of the soot grains
00:27:24.976 determines the final price.
00:27:27.562 Then there's the bindingagent: animal glue.
00:27:31.191 Unlike most of its modernliquid-ink counterparts,
00:27:33.943 which use shellac, sumi inktypically uses cattle glue.
00:27:38.365 For the most expensive ink sticks,
00:27:40.450 artisans sometimes mixin other types of glue,
00:27:43.119 such as donkey, deer, and goat.
00:27:46.581 Kobaien says this improves
00:27:48.541 the ink's glossiness and texture.
00:27:52.045 The company buys gluespecially made for sumi ink,
00:27:55.632 which comes in a dry, board-like form.
00:27:58.385 Artisans dissolve it by mixing it
00:28:00.345 with 70-degree-Celsius water,
00:28:02.597 which takes over an hour and a half.
00:28:05.725 According to Kobaien,dissolving the glue slowly
00:28:08.561 at a low temperature is keyto producing quality ink.
00:28:35.422 Narrator: But animal gluecan have a bad smell,
00:28:37.966 so sumi-ink makers add fragrance
00:28:40.635 like borneol and musk to counteract it.
00:28:59.237 Narrator: The next step isto knead the soot, glue,
00:29:01.906 and fragrance into a soft dough.
00:29:07.328 The dough is kneaded everymorning by hand and foot.
00:29:14.836 Toshitsugu takes careto knead it thoroughly,
00:29:17.839 so the soot and glueare evenly distributed.
00:29:21.676 That way, the solid stickcan eventually dissolve
00:29:24.637 into homogenous liquid ink.
00:29:30.643 Once he's properly kneaded the dough,
00:29:32.896 Toshitsugu cuts it into balls
00:29:34.939 and weighs them for consistency.
00:29:40.779 Then he places the balls into molds
00:29:43.281 and uses a machine topress them into shape.
00:29:48.161 Improperly kneaded doughresults in ink sticks
00:29:50.830 that don't produce rich color.
00:30:23.446 Narrator: Kobaien makesabout 6,000 of its smallest,
00:30:26.324 highest-quality ink sticks a month.
00:30:29.327 It employs a handful of artisans for this,
00:30:31.913 and the ones tasked with kneading
00:30:33.957 require the most experience.
00:30:36.793 It takes five years to trainas a sumi ink craftsperson,
00:30:41.297 but 10 years before they're allowed
00:30:43.091 to make high-quality ink.
00:30:47.053 Kobaien produces almost 40,000
00:30:49.722 of its smallest sumi ink sticksbetween October and April,
00:30:54.102 when the cooler weather of winter
00:30:55.645 ensures the glue canharden during shaping.
00:31:01.609 But the work isn't done yet.
00:31:04.028 Drying the ink sticks tooquickly will cause them to crack,
00:31:07.699 making them unsellable.
00:31:09.909 So artisans rely on atraditional technique,
00:31:12.829 using oak ash to slowly absorbmoisture from the sticks
00:31:16.165 over a long period of time.
00:31:18.751 They start by coveringthe sticks in moist ashes.
00:31:22.839 Each day, they swap yesterday'sashes with drier ones.
00:31:27.302 They repeat this processfor up to 40 days,
00:31:30.305 until the ink sticks are about 70% dry.
00:31:40.106 After, they hang the sticks with straw
00:31:42.692 and air-dry them in-housefor up to six months.
00:31:46.654 Properly drying and maturing an ink stick
00:31:48.948 takes at least four years.
00:31:51.784 The longer the sticks dry and age,
00:31:53.870 the better they perform andthe more expensive they become.
00:31:59.083 Kobaien itself has ink sticks
00:32:01.336 that are hundreds of years old.
00:32:36.704 Narrator: Finally, artisans polish them
00:32:39.165 and apply the finishing touches.
00:32:42.418 Now they're ready to be sold
00:32:43.878 to calligraphers like Sho Azakami.
00:32:48.216 Calligraphers like Sho
00:32:49.801 traditionally prefer inksticks to liquid ink.
00:32:53.304 But in order to writewith a sumi ink stick,
00:32:55.974 he must first transform it into a liquid.
00:32:59.102 This requires an inkstone and water.
00:33:02.522 Sho adds a small amount of water
00:33:04.649 and rubs the ink stick onthe stone, breaking it apart.
00:33:08.653 He mixes the two to make the liquid ink,
00:33:10.989 adding more water or more dry ink
00:33:13.449 until he gets the consistency he needs.
00:33:43.021 Narrator: But not allsumi inks provide him
00:33:45.440 with the same writing experience.
00:34:12.925 Narrator: 95% of Japan'ssumi ink is made here,
00:34:16.637 in Nara Prefecture.
00:34:18.973 Sumi ink production in Japan
00:34:21.016 is said to have begunin the seventh century,
00:34:23.561 when Chinese ink-making methodswere introduced by monks.
00:34:27.732 By the 14th century, sumi inkuse was flourishing in Japan.
00:34:33.362 Though its primary use is for calligraphy,
00:34:35.864 it's also often used for inkpaintings, known as sumi-e.
00:34:40.578 And because Kobaienmust age its ink sticks
00:34:43.121 for several years before it can sell them,
00:34:45.750 consistent production is necessary,
00:34:47.793 or else its supply won't meet the demand.
00:34:51.422 But that doesn't mean the company wants
00:34:53.049 to ramp up its production.
00:35:08.940 Narrator: Kobaien strivesto continue making
00:35:10.775 calligraphy ink using the same techniques
00:35:13.319 and of the same quality as its founders.
00:35:33.464 Narrator: Stevie Dennisis harvesting a cluster
00:35:35.591 of gooseneck barnacles,
00:35:37.093 one of the most expensiveseafoods in the world.
00:35:40.471 Just 1 pound can cost over$100 in Spain and Portugal,
00:35:44.559 where the barnacles areconsidered a delicacy.
00:35:47.311 That's about seven times theprice of some Maine lobster.
00:35:51.232 But getting your hands on these barnacles
00:35:52.900 is harder than it seems.
00:35:54.861 The job comes with serious risks,
00:35:57.280 and even the possibility of death.
00:36:00.199 So why are gooseneck barnaclesso difficult to harvest?
00:36:03.619 And is this what makes them so expensive?
00:36:08.583 Gooseneck barnacles, alsoknown in Europe as percebes,
00:36:12.044 have a long, fleshystalk called a peduncle,
00:36:14.714 which holds the highlysought-after meat you can eat.
00:36:18.092 People say it tastes likelobster, crab, or clam.
00:36:22.054 They grow in intertidalzones, including in Spain,
00:36:25.474 where an average of five people die
00:36:27.226 trying to harvest them each year.
00:36:29.896 They also grow here, off thecoast of Vancouver Island.
00:36:34.609 The danger of harvesting this seafood
00:36:36.569 begins before Stevieand his partner, Jordan,
00:36:39.447 even reach the small rockisland where the barnacles grow.
00:36:44.785 The 15-minute boat ride offthe coast starts off smooth.
00:36:49.040 But wait a little longer,
00:36:50.333 and the waves will be thrustinghigh as Stevie attempts
00:36:53.002 to make the leap fromthe boat onto the rocks.
00:37:02.053 Stevie's only able to harvest at low tide,
00:37:04.513 when he can access the rocks.
00:37:07.308 He can harvest only as longas the tide will allow him,
00:37:10.853 which is just a few hours a day.
00:37:14.523 Outside of this limited window,
00:37:16.317 the barnacles are covered by water
00:37:18.110 and too dangerous to harvest.
00:37:20.905 Jordan: It's not like youhave a full eight-hour window
00:37:22.698 to go harvest as manygoosenecks as you can.
00:37:25.243 You have this very short window,
00:37:26.369 and you're going to tryand capitalize on that.
00:37:30.206 Narrator: It's essential forStevie to do the job fast,
00:37:32.792 but carefully.
00:37:34.543 He harvests while constantlychecking the tide.
00:37:37.338 One slip, and the wavescould take him under.
00:37:41.425 Jordan: It just boilsdown to skilled labor.
00:37:44.011 It's not a job that anyone can do.
00:37:46.013 Especially when you're workingwith a small team of people,
00:37:49.433 you want to have fulltrust that both individuals
00:37:51.894 can drive a vessel, bothindividuals can harvest.
00:37:54.981 You have each other's back out there.
00:37:58.901 Narrator: To add to the risks,the most prized barnacles
00:38:01.487 thrive in the most dangerousspots on the island.
00:38:04.740 These ones are denserand packed with meat.
00:38:07.535 And they grow on the edge of the rocks,
00:38:09.328 where the waves are constantlythrashing against them.
00:38:13.040 The barnacles here must feed more often
00:38:14.875 so they can grow biggerto withstand the surf,
00:38:17.628 which is how they're able
00:38:18.504 to cling more tightly to the rocks.
00:38:21.382 But this also makes themespecially difficult to remove.
00:38:28.556 Stevie uses a leaf spring tool
00:38:30.141 to pry out clumps of gooseneck barnacles.
00:38:33.060 Stevie: My uncle gave it to me.
00:38:34.312 He used to harvest goosenecks.
00:38:37.356 Narrator: At times, he uses his hands
00:38:39.108 to pull them out one by one.
00:38:42.486 While worrying about his own safety,
00:38:44.864 Stevie must also be careful
00:38:46.407 with how he harvests the barnacles.
00:38:49.285 Harvesters try to avoid taking
00:38:51.162 or harming other organismsattached to the barnacles.
00:38:54.623 And they take extra care not to damage
00:38:56.417 the gooseneck barnacle itself,
00:38:58.627 since slicing through it willautomatically lower its value.
00:39:03.007 Marketable barnacles willhave a hard white plate
00:39:05.634 at the end that's about15 to 30 millimeters long.
00:39:09.638 The peduncle should bebetween 20 and 80 millimeters.
00:39:13.601 At each harvest site in Vancouver,
00:39:15.603 less than 10% of the barnacles
00:39:17.229 will be considered marketable.
00:39:19.523 Stevie: You want somewith length, you know?
00:39:21.734 It's like, picture a forest.
00:39:26.030 The further you go in and find
00:39:27.823 where the trees are alittle bit more protected,
00:39:31.911 the top of the tree
00:39:33.496 is where you're goingto find the branches,
00:39:35.831 and they're going to have long trunks,
00:39:37.833 so that's the meat that you eat.
00:39:40.920 Narrator: As plentiful asthis rock island looks,
00:39:43.172 there's a limit to how manybarnacles Stevie can take.
00:39:46.467 Once fishers harvest 7.5%
00:39:48.844 of the marketable gooseneckbarnacles from a rock,
00:39:51.639 that rock will be closed for six months
00:39:53.808 to prevent overharvesting.
00:39:59.772 After Stevie and Jordan return,
00:40:01.690 they transport the barnaclesto local restaurants.
00:40:05.694 In Vancouver, they're delivered fresh,
00:40:07.696 since the barnacles degrade rapidly.
00:40:10.032 And if frozen, they'lllose much of their texture
00:40:12.243 and flavor when thawed,making them less valuable.
00:40:15.871 Jordan: Say for salmon,you can serve fresh salmon,
00:40:18.416 and then you can freeze it,and then you can smoke it.
00:40:21.502 You can push the longevityof that product months.
00:40:25.089 Goosenecks aren't like that.
00:40:27.007 Lisa Ahier: They're nice and fat.
00:40:28.509 Stevie: Yeah, that'swhat I was looking for.
00:40:31.137 Narrator: The barnacles aregraded on an A, B, and C scale,
00:40:34.098 based on how much meat they hold.
00:40:36.183 Jordan: Your A's aregoing to be aesthetically
00:40:39.019 quite pleasing, very full,and then firmness of meat.
00:40:43.983 Narrator: Grades aside, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds
00:40:46.902 of gooseneck barnacleswill typically only yield
00:40:49.780 just over 1/2 a pound of meat.
00:40:52.450 Lisa: I want to preparethem as cleanly as possible,
00:40:55.202 which means you can taste allof the flavor that's inside.
00:40:58.873 And for me, it tastes like the ocean.
00:41:01.709 That looks like the headof a dinosaur, doesn't it?
00:41:03.794 With the eye and the –
00:41:04.753 I always call them dinosaur toes.
00:41:09.049 Narrator: In Vancouver,gooseneck barnacles
00:41:10.885 have long been atraditional source of food
00:41:13.304 for the members of theNuu-chah-nulth First Nations.
00:41:16.974 Today, Stevie hopes tosell gooseneck barnacles
00:41:19.310 for $20 a pound.
00:41:21.479 That's about $6 morethan the cost per pound
00:41:24.064 of hard-shell lobster.
00:41:26.066 But in places like Spain and Portugal,
00:41:28.444 percebes are considered a delicacy,
00:41:31.113 which is why they can cost even more –
00:41:33.240 sometimes over $100 per pound.
00:41:37.077 Prices are especially high in the summer
00:41:39.371 and around the holidays,
00:41:40.915 when the people thereeat percebes most often.
00:41:44.585 As gooseneck barnacles pop up
00:41:46.086 in more high-end restaurantsin Canada and the US,
00:41:49.089 the demand could grow inthat region of the world.
00:41:52.259 But for now, the value of this crustacean
00:41:54.512 is clear enough to thelocals in Vancouver.
00:41:57.890 People will say, "What does it taste like?
00:41:59.683 Is it like a crab, like ashrimp, like a lobster?"
00:42:03.229 I guess. Maybe you could say that.
00:42:05.648 But I look forward to the day when we say,
00:42:09.276 "Ooh, the crab and the lobster,
00:42:10.945 a little bit like a gooseneck barnacle."
00:42:15.366 Narrator: Using rare granite
00:42:16.617 from just one island in the world,
00:42:19.036 experienced stonemasonsturn these giant boulders
00:42:22.122 into hundreds of uniform curling stones.
00:42:25.834 But these aren't just any curling stones.
00:42:28.921 They're the only onesallowed in the Olympic Games.
00:42:32.299 A single stone certified forthe Olympics costs over $600.
00:42:37.012 That makes a full set of16 stones worth $9,600.
00:42:42.434 So, how are Olympic curling stones made?
00:42:45.521 And why are they so expensive?
00:42:50.901 Since 2006, every curling stone
00:42:53.445 used in the Olympic WinterGames has come from here.
00:42:57.408 It's produced stones since 1851.
00:43:00.202 But today, there are just 10 people
00:43:02.288 in the world who make them.
00:43:05.249 Mark: They love what they do.
00:43:06.375 They're very passionate about it
00:43:07.793 because they know that this particular
00:43:09.712 block of granite they're working on
00:43:11.171 that becomes a curling stone
00:43:12.631 could be the stone that's thrown
00:43:14.091 for the gold medal at the Olympic Games.
00:43:16.010 It could be the stone thatdecides a world championship.
00:43:19.722 Narrator: Every stonecomes from one tiny island
00:43:22.182 off the coast of Scotland.
00:43:24.977 For over a century, masons have ventured
00:43:27.104 to Ailsa Craig island to harvestgranite for curling stones.
00:43:31.734 Until its lease expires in 2050,
00:43:33.861 Kays is the only company in the world
00:43:35.696 with permission to harvest granite here.
00:43:38.782 And for curling, AilsaCraig's granite structure
00:43:41.410 is the gold standard.
00:43:43.746 But getting granite to themainland is far from simple.
00:43:47.916 Well, the harvesting process
00:43:49.209 is a logistical work of art, I think.
00:43:53.756 There is nothing onthe island, as you say.
00:43:55.174 It's uninhabited. There's no water supply
00:43:57.509 other than some running water
00:43:58.719 from the rivers and streams on the island.
00:44:01.680 There's no electricity supply.
00:44:03.140 So we have to take absolutelyeverything with us.
00:44:06.935 Narrator: Kays uses two types of granite
00:44:08.604 from the island to produce curling stones.
00:44:11.231 First, there's blue hone granite,
00:44:13.275 which makes up the layerthat runs along the ice.
00:44:16.403 Then common green is used for the part
00:44:18.614 that strikes other stones.
00:44:20.991 This is Ailsa Craig common green granite.
00:44:23.285 So this makes up thefull body of the stone.
00:44:25.454 You can also see this slightly lighter,
00:44:27.122 grayer-color granite inside,
00:44:29.333 and this is Ailsa Craig blue hone.
00:44:32.086 Narrator: The rock is densely constructed,
00:44:34.171 thanks to how well itsfine-grained crystals
00:44:36.799 and the feldspar interlock.
00:44:39.051 This makes the stone resilient.
00:44:41.261 While other rocks might crack or splinter,
00:44:43.389 Ailsa Craig granite stays intact
00:44:45.307 amid cold temperatures and collisions.
00:44:48.143 Most other rocks will have imperfections,
00:44:50.688 like veins that cut through the stone.
00:44:52.898 And while it's not free from weaknesses,
00:44:55.109 there aren't manythroughout Ailsa Craig rock.
00:44:57.903 Weaknesses make it more likely
00:44:59.655 a stone will fracture upon hard impact,
00:45:02.658 something that would upend a curling game.
00:45:07.162 Before Kays can begin making stones,
00:45:09.456 each rock is cut into slabs.
00:45:11.750 But not all the granitethe company harvests
00:45:14.169 is suitable for a curling stone.
00:45:16.839 Sometimes areas of a slabhave small imperfections
00:45:19.842 that could cause it toerode or impact the game.
00:45:23.303 Mark: It's generallybecause there's a flaw
00:45:25.222 or a fissure or a crackor something in it.
00:45:28.016 Narrator: This is where theeye of the masons comes in.
00:45:31.603 Throughout the process,they assess the granite
00:45:33.814 and confirm it satisfiesOlympic requirements.
00:45:37.609 Mark: The slab thickness,we are looking for
00:45:39.403 145 millimeters, you know,14.5 centimeters, thick.
00:45:43.323 Then that gives us theideal depth for coring,
00:45:46.076 which then allows us to shape the stone
00:45:47.911 while retaining the weight.
00:45:50.247 Narrator: From the slab, Kays marks
00:45:51.707 only the best parts worth coring,
00:45:53.959 which are the areas it'lleventually shape into stones.
00:45:57.963 Mark: We've gone to alot of time and effort
00:45:59.506 to bring this resource from an island
00:46:01.383 over to the mainland that we want to make
00:46:03.635 the most effective use out of it.
00:46:05.512 We can get boulders off the island
00:46:07.556 that can be in theregion of 5 to 7 tonnes.
00:46:09.892 They will yield way more thanfive or six cheeses per tonne.
00:46:14.354 But if we average it outacross a whole harvest,
00:46:16.732 then if we get aroundsix cheeses per tonne,
00:46:19.067 we're doing pretty well.
00:46:20.444 Narrator: They call them cheeses,
00:46:22.029 for no clear reason other than:
00:46:24.072 Mark: I suppose in onerespect, they maybe look
00:46:25.783 like a Babybel cheeseor something like that.
00:46:28.452 I've never really thought aboutit too deeply, to be honest.
00:46:34.082 Narrator: While the process today
00:46:35.125 largely depends on machines,
00:46:37.127 it needs experienced craftspeopleto see each stage through.
00:46:41.465 Mark: The cutting processor the coring process
00:46:43.759 is a skill and an art in itself.
00:46:46.595 So while it's semiautomaticin terms of feeding itself in,
00:46:49.890 the speed is manually controlled,
00:46:51.433 and that's where the skillof the operator comes in.
00:46:54.853 Narrator: After eachcheese has been cored,
00:46:56.688 masons chip away the excessstone around the corners
00:46:59.775 and prepare it for shaping.
00:47:02.277 The International Olympic Committee
00:47:03.821 determines the size, shape,
00:47:05.489 and weight of each stone for the games.
00:47:08.867 Before the stone reaches its final shape,
00:47:11.578 masons fit the blue hone granite
00:47:13.580 into the common green body.
00:47:17.835 The stone itself weighs 40 pounds,
00:47:20.295 plus another pound for the handle.
00:47:23.423 After it reaches its final form,
00:47:25.342 it's time to polish it.
00:47:28.345 Each stone needs to be uniform in weight,
00:47:30.889 size, and running surface.
00:47:33.892 The running surface on the bottom
00:47:35.352 determines how much the stone curls.
00:47:38.313 To curl, there needs to be friction
00:47:40.065 between the ice and the stone.
00:47:42.651 That roughness is achieved
00:47:44.111 by the experienced hand of a mason.
00:47:50.284 Kays stores granite over time,
00:47:52.244 returning to Ailsa Craigabout once a decade.
00:47:55.789 Other producers harvest granite
00:47:57.416 from the Trefor Quarry in Wales.
00:48:00.335 Kays once sourcedgranite from Trefor, too.
00:48:02.880 But Mark says quality-controlissues turned it away.
00:48:06.592 And it didn't hurt that theWorld Curling Federation
00:48:09.553 preferred Ailsa Craig stones.
00:48:12.014 Mark: They found that theKays stones with the insert,
00:48:14.558 the blue hone insert, were the best,
00:48:16.518 because they also discoveredthat having a curling stone
00:48:19.605 that's not got a bluehone insert will pit.
00:48:23.025 It has a certain porosity,it will pull in water,
00:48:26.445 and water and ice will then freeze.
00:48:28.363 When water freezes, it expands;
00:48:30.073 leads to the detriment orthe damage to the stone.
00:48:34.036 Narrator: While curling has recently
00:48:35.412 skyrocketed in popularity,demand for stones
00:48:38.540 has fluctuated since the game began.
00:48:41.752 Curling is believed tohave started in Scotland,
00:48:44.338 but today, Canada isthe most successful team
00:48:47.090 in the history of curling.
00:48:49.343 Curling here goes back tothe late 19th century ...
00:48:52.429 Clip: A curling stone getssome last-minute polishing.
00:48:55.474 Narrator: When many of theScots who immigrated to Canada
00:48:58.018 brought the game with them.
00:48:59.603 By the '50s, Canada was building
00:49:01.480 hundreds of curling rinks.
00:49:03.690 Now retired, Jimmy Wyllie workedat Kays during this period
00:49:07.402 and saw the company thrivebefore demand dropped again.
00:49:11.239 Jimmy: When all of thesenew ice rinks in Canada
00:49:13.367 were satisfied, the demandfell off dramatically.
00:49:16.703 So we went from 25, 30 people
00:49:19.373 down to about between five and 10 people.
00:49:25.379 Narrator: A major componentthat's kept the game —
00:49:27.506 and Kays — alive today:the Winter Olympics.
00:49:32.219 Mark: When curling was putback into the Olympics,
00:49:33.845 it was great.
00:49:34.972 It was a really — itwas a momentous moment
00:49:37.516 in terms of a curling-stone manufacturer,
00:49:39.935 because it suddenly openedcurling up to the world.
00:49:43.313 During 1990, there was only25 countries in the world
00:49:46.608 that were in any way involved in curling.
00:49:48.860 And now, 20 years later,that's almost tripled.
00:49:52.280 Narrator: As of 2022, 67countries compete in curling.
00:49:56.451 Naturally, that's created anuptick in demand for stones,
00:49:59.496 which has carried over into their price.
00:50:02.207 Mark: We have increased our sales,
00:50:03.709 which is really, really good news.
00:50:05.794 And having said that, we'vealso increased our cost,
00:50:08.296 because we have to go backfor granite more frequently
00:50:11.842 to satisfy the demand.
00:50:13.969 Narrator: In 2000, Kays harvested
00:50:15.595 about 1,500 metric tons of common green
00:50:18.682 and about 300 metric tons of blue hone.
00:50:21.727 13 years later, it took 2,500metric tons of common green
00:50:25.772 and 500 metric tons of blue hone.
00:50:28.817 Fortunately for the growinginterest in the sport,
00:50:31.153 and for the only supplierof Olympic curling stones,
00:50:33.989 supply isn't a problem.
00:50:37.159 Mark: The last harvest, in November 2020,
00:50:39.161 we took less than 0.01% of the island.
00:50:43.790 So we're scratching the surface.
00:50:46.251 The whole island is made of granite.
00:50:47.627 We're not making that big a dent in it.
00:50:55.719 [Narrator] Japanesesword making is a tradition
00:50:57.763 that goes back centuries,
00:50:59.723 and one that's carried on to this day.
00:51:02.809 Each sword requires dedication, skill,
00:51:05.604 and can take over 18 months to create.
00:51:09.066 The resulting blade can beworth thousands of dollars.
00:51:12.402 So, what makes them so expensive?
00:51:42.516 Master Akihira has beenmaking swords for 21 years.
00:51:46.478 He was inspired by a swordcrafted by the legendary
00:51:49.397 13th century swordsmith Masamune.
00:51:52.484 After a five year apprenticeship,and years of training,
00:51:55.695 he became one of the 180 swordsmiths
00:51:58.532 working across Japan.
00:52:02.077 Japanese swords have alwaysbeen more than just weapons.
00:52:05.247 They were artworks, statussymbols, and throughout history,
00:52:08.708 held a huge spiritual importance.
00:53:45.680 Each sword is a unique artwork,
00:53:47.682 and one that is made to beadmired as you would a painting.
00:53:50.977 As sheets of steel
00:53:51.895 are folded into eachother again and again,
00:53:54.439 wood grain like patternsform, and these patterns,
00:53:57.275 coupled with the skill of the sword master
00:53:59.319 create a completely unique blade.
00:54:28.682 Knowing what to look forin each sword is important.
00:54:32.102 Characteristics like theangle and length of the blade,
00:54:35.438 or the way the metal is folded,
00:54:37.065 could give away the erain which it was made,
00:54:39.609 and even who made it.
00:55:25.113 Looking at the months of work
00:55:26.489 that go in to creating each blade,
00:55:28.575 it's easy to see why theseswords come at such a price.
00:55:33.038 As there are less and lesssword masters across Japan,
00:55:36.166 these works or art are onlygoing to become more valuable.
00:56:15.288 Narrator: To make muga silk,
00:56:16.623 laborers must unwind amuga caterpillar's cocoon
00:56:19.918 into a single long seamless thread.
00:56:23.254 And to make just one sari,
00:56:24.964 about 1,000 cocoons need to be unraveled.
00:56:29.594 A sari made of muga silkcan cost up to $6,500,
00:56:33.556 thousands more than other saris.
00:56:37.394 But the caterpillarsneeded to make the cocoons,
00:56:40.021 also called muga seeds,
00:56:41.773 might be in danger of disappearing.
00:56:44.192 And without them, farmerscan't produce muga silk at all.
00:56:48.154 So why is muga silk so expensive?
00:56:50.949 And what's hurting thecaterpillars needed to make it?
00:57:02.460 Muga can only be made inthe Assam region of India.
00:57:06.256 It's so central to the culture here
00:57:08.299 that there's even a traditional song
00:57:10.093 about the golden thread.
00:57:15.265 Muga silk is unique
00:57:16.307 because of its naturallylustrous gold color.
00:57:18.935 It can last up to 100 years,
00:57:20.895 and it's said to offer protection
00:57:22.355 by absorbing 85% of harmful UV rays.
00:57:26.693 But these properties alsomake it more expensive,
00:57:29.571 and the labor and expensesrequired to make muga silk
00:57:32.490 bump the price even further.
00:58:07.942 Narrator: They pick a maleand female moth to mate
00:58:10.236 and tie the female to the khorika,
00:58:12.280 a stick with a hook madeof thatch grass or twine.
00:58:15.492 This is where the femalewill lay its eggs.
00:58:19.287 Rearers then transfer thekhorika to a som tree,
00:58:22.290 the host plant for muga worms.
00:58:25.335 Here, tiny ash-coloredlarvae, known as chai muga,
00:58:28.713 hatch and begin to feed on the leaves.
00:58:31.925 But the larvae arevulnerable at this stage,
00:58:34.052 so farmers need to keep a watchful eye
00:58:36.137 to ensure they can form the cocoons
00:58:37.931 needed to make muga silk.
00:58:41.809 They shoot clay pellets into the fields
00:58:43.895 to keep potential predatorsat bay and protect the larvae.
00:58:52.111 After one or two months,
00:58:53.613 they can collect the mature caterpillars.
00:59:10.338 Narrator: Here, the caterpillars rest
00:59:11.798 and weave their cocoons for three days,
00:59:14.092 until they fully empty the silk glands
00:59:15.760 and enter pupation.
00:59:18.263 Not all cocoons are used for silk.
00:59:21.683 Some are stored in the chakori pera,
00:59:23.977 a bamboo box for keeping cocoons and moths
00:59:26.396 so farmers can continuebreeding muga worms.
00:59:30.108 The hatched cocoons areused for rougher fabrics,
00:59:32.902 such as winter clothes and blankets.
00:59:36.072 But the most expensive muga fabrics
00:59:38.366 come from unhatched cocoons.
00:59:41.619 That's because the silk inthese cocoons isn't torn
00:59:44.414 and can be unraveledinto a continuous thread.
00:59:49.085 Besides being limited inwhich cocoons they can use,
00:59:51.921 weavers also need a lot of them.
00:59:54.632 For weavers who buy cocoons,this doesn't come cheap.
01:00:13.192 Narrator: To produce 1kilogram of muga yarn,
01:00:15.612 Monika needs 5,000 cocoons,
01:00:18.239 which is enough for about five saris.
01:00:21.576 And that 1 kilogram could take her a week,
01:00:24.287 because to make the yarn,
01:00:25.580 she needs to reel the golden thread,
01:00:27.624 a process that demands special care.
01:00:30.418 Traditionally, the Assameseadd dried banana peel
01:00:33.338 or paddy thatch ash to the mixture,
01:00:35.632 which degums the cocoon andgives the thread a better sheen.
01:00:39.427 And when it comes to muga,the shinier the silk,
01:00:41.971 the more valuable it will be.
01:00:45.350 Two people then use abhangoi to carefully reel
01:00:48.478 the long muga silk threadsin a continuous motion.
01:00:53.816 Reelers gently pull from several cocoons
01:00:56.277 and join the thin strings together
01:00:57.987 to make one thicker thread.
01:01:01.491 They must make sure each threadhas a consistent thickness,
01:01:04.661 or the yarn won't be as valuable.
01:01:08.039 Finally, the rearersload the muga silk yarn
01:01:10.416 onto bamboo looms,
01:01:11.959 where Assamese women weaveit into the desired fabric.
01:01:18.424 Some of the most intricate saris
01:01:20.093 made from regular silkcan cost $250 in India,
01:01:23.846 but the same design on a muga silk fabric
01:01:26.432 can kick the price up into the thousands.
01:01:35.066 Muga silk is the pride of Assam,
01:01:37.318 which accounts for almost all of India's
01:01:39.153 muga silk production.
01:01:40.822 But the profits are limited.
01:02:08.766 Narrator: While mugafarmers work tirelessly
01:02:10.643 to ensure the moths survive,it's not only up to them.
01:02:14.772 The muga moth is continuously threatened
01:02:16.774 by the climate crisis.
01:02:19.235 Muga silkworms are reared outdoors,
01:02:21.529 and exposure to even the slightest change
01:02:23.740 in temperature andhumidity can wreak havoc.
01:02:28.494 During high temperatures in 2018,
01:02:30.830 farmers had to delayrearing for 10 to 15 days
01:02:33.708 to avoid silkworm deaths.
01:02:36.377 Losing this time duringpeak commercial season,
01:02:39.046 when production is ramping up,
01:02:41.215 means producers can end upwith less muga silk to sell.
01:03:03.070 Narrator: These chemicalshave toxic effects
01:03:04.781 on the muga moth that impact its mortality
01:03:07.241 and ability to reproduce.
01:03:11.412 This can threaten therelatively low production
01:03:13.748 of muga silk,
01:03:14.791 compared to other expensiveIndian-made silks,
01:03:17.210 like mulberry silk.
01:03:19.253 Only about 239 metric tons of muga silk
01:03:22.131 were produced in India in 2021.
01:03:25.051 Compare that to over 24,000metric tons of mulberry silk
01:03:28.638 that were produced in the same year.
01:03:31.098 According to Jitul,
01:03:32.391 this doesn't meet global demand for muga,
01:03:34.477 and it drives the price even higher.
01:03:37.605 The limited supply of authentic muga silk
01:03:40.274 has led some producers tofill the gap with fakes.
01:03:43.820 To combat the rise of fake muga,
01:03:46.072 in 2007, the Indian governmentdesignated Assam muga silk
01:03:50.493 as a protected geographicalindication, or GI, product.
01:03:54.831 This means authentic mugasilk can only come from Assam.
01:03:58.501 But Jitul doesn't believe it's done much
01:04:00.503 to help Assam's muga silk production.
01:04:22.817 Narrator: That's why Jituland other muga farmers
01:04:25.194 are relying on environmentalconservation efforts
01:04:28.239 now and in the future
01:04:29.657 to ensure the survival ofthis millennia-old fabric.
01:04:34.036 Narrator: About 20,000pounds of sea urchins
01:04:36.831 are delivered to this SantaBarbara factory each week.
01:04:40.585 But it's not until youcrack open the spiky shells
01:04:43.588 that you see what makessea urchins so valuable:
01:04:47.550 the gonads.
01:04:49.677 Just one 200-gram tray ofurchin gonads like this
01:04:53.639 can cost $100.
01:04:55.975 And some in Japan can sellfor over five times that.
01:05:00.104 Sea urchins are one of the few seafoods
01:05:02.231 still hand-harvested by divers today.
01:05:05.276 And in recent years,
01:05:06.444 masses of them have taken overthe seabeds of California.
01:05:10.698 So why are there so many urchins?
01:05:13.492 And how, despite thisseemingly huge supply,
01:05:16.871 are they still so expensive?
01:05:21.208 Sea urchin, or uni, is a prized delicacy
01:05:24.253 in several parts of the world.
01:05:26.339 Today, the yellow-orange gonads
01:05:27.882 are often served in sushi
01:05:29.967 and even right out of the shell.
01:05:32.637 Hundreds of urchin species exist,
01:05:35.097 but only a select few are coveted food,
01:05:37.725 including the red sea urchinhere in Santa Barbara.
01:05:41.270 Known as "California gold,"these gonads are prized
01:05:44.440 because they're large, buttery,
01:05:46.067 and sweet from the kelp they eat.
01:05:48.778 To find gonads like this,divers need to collect
01:05:51.656 individual sea urchins by hand.
01:05:55.868 Michael Robertson has beendiving for urchins for 15 years.
01:06:00.498 He starts his days early,
01:06:02.333 sailing out before the sun rises.
01:06:06.212 It takes him and his crewabout two and a half hours
01:06:08.714 to reach a good diving spot.
01:06:11.300 Michael: See that little island up there?
01:06:15.638 That's called Bee Rock.
01:06:17.515 That's where we're going.
01:06:19.934 So, all this green right here
01:06:22.144 on top of this red, that's reef,
01:06:24.230 is vegetation.
01:06:25.606 That's a good thing.
01:06:26.565 That lets us know it's not sand
01:06:28.275 and it's just not bare rock.
01:06:30.277 If there's vegetation,maybe there's urchins.
01:06:33.990 Narrator: Michael looksfor abundant kelp forests
01:06:36.075 to help him decide where to dive.
01:06:39.286 More kelp typically meansbetter-quality urchins.
01:06:45.793 Gene Demachi: 2010, on a good day,
01:06:47.712 a diver could harvest maybeup to 2,000 pounds a day
01:06:50.589 of good-quality sea urchins.
01:06:52.508 Now the divers are typically coming in
01:06:54.677 with about 300 to 500 pounds a day.
01:06:57.304 So a quarter of the amount.
01:07:00.016 Narrator: But surprisingly,
01:07:01.183 parts of California'sseabeds are full of urchins.
01:07:05.354 Gene: If they wanted to,they could still bring in
01:07:07.398 2,000 pounds a day. There's alot of sea urchins out there,
01:07:10.735 but there's a lack of kelp.
01:07:12.820 So even if you bring in 2,000 pounds,
01:07:15.072 if they're not marketable,then we don't harvest them.
01:07:20.286 Michael: If you want to comparehow it was to how it is,
01:07:23.539 this was solid kelp,
01:07:25.124 from here, all the wayin, all the way down.
01:07:29.545 And now you have just littlepockets here and there.
01:07:34.675 Narrator: That lack of kelp
01:07:35.968 impacts the value of red sea urchins.
01:07:38.679 It also strains the ocean's ecosystem
01:07:41.223 and the species that relyon kelp forests for habitat.
01:07:44.977 Along with warming waters andpollution in recent decades,
01:07:48.731 a certain sea urchin is to blame.
01:07:52.109 Sea urchins can survivefor years without eating,
01:07:54.820 even without gonads.
01:07:56.989 And after the decline of seastars, one of its predators,
01:08:00.117 in 2013, the purple seaurchin population exploded,
01:08:04.705 consuming more than 95%
01:08:06.499 of California's kelp forests as it grew.
01:08:09.335 Purple urchins are smallerand produce fewer gonads,
01:08:12.338 so there's littlecommercial demand for them.
01:08:14.924 And as purple urchinsmultiply and eat more kelp,
01:08:17.885 red urchins with good gonads
01:08:19.720 become harder for divers to find.
01:08:23.474 Finding the right spot to diveis just the first challenge.
01:08:27.685 Getting your hands on thesespiky creatures is the main one.
01:08:32.774 Michael: Some peoplewonder if sea-urchin diving
01:08:35.486 is a dangerous occupation.
01:08:37.529 It can be as dangerous as you allow it.
01:08:40.491 If you don't keep reallytight tabs on your gear
01:08:44.828 and the mechanics of yourboat, it could easily kill you.
01:08:51.210 Narrator: To make the job easier,
01:08:52.419 Michael and his partner,Fred, need specific tools.
01:08:55.965 Michael: So, this is the oneessential piece of equipment
01:08:58.634 everybody has to have. It's called a rake.
01:09:00.970 It's custom-made. Everybodyhas their own take
01:09:03.680 on how they like to have it done.
01:09:05.390 I've got all these fancy colors on mine,
01:09:06.767 because if I ever drop it,
01:09:10.479 I'll be able to see it on the bottom.
01:09:12.022 And my daughter loves putting the tape on.
01:09:25.493 Narrator: Once they're suited up,
01:09:26.578 Michael and Fred head to the bottom
01:09:28.205 and begin collecting urchins one by one.
01:09:31.082 Michael: All right.
01:09:33.252 Narrator: Even with the proper gear,
01:09:34.837 a good dive is never a guarantee.
01:09:43.679 Typically, there areonly about five gonads
01:09:46.307 inside each urchin.
01:09:48.142 And without enough kelpfor the urchins to feed on,
01:09:50.603 the gonads start to shrivel up.
01:09:52.645 In some cases, an urchinwill be totally empty inside.
01:09:56.358 Michael: We do crack urchins on the bottom
01:09:58.068 so that we can see what we're picking,
01:09:59.653 if there's enough product inside,
01:10:01.113 and what the color is like inside.
01:10:03.616 Narrator: To make things more challenging,
01:10:05.409 Michael can only harvest urchins
01:10:07.119 at least 3 1/4 inches in size.
01:10:10.539 Michael: You can't just goout and pick empty urchins.
01:10:13.042 So there's a lot more empty urchins
01:10:16.045 than there is beautiful packed urchins
01:10:19.089 that you'd want to sell.
01:10:20.758 Depending on what they're eating
01:10:22.218 depends on the grade of the urchin.
01:10:26.680 We got lucky on that one.
01:10:28.557 Radio: Oh, right on. Sounds good.
01:10:30.059 OK, cool, man. See youon the other side there.
01:10:32.728 Roger that.
01:10:36.273 Narrator: After a 12-hourday to the islands and back,
01:10:39.360 Michael returns with 750to 900 pounds of urchins.
01:10:45.824 The shelf life of fresh urchins is short,
01:10:48.285 so they need to be deliveredto processors that same night.
01:10:53.874 By 4 a.m., Gene Demachi's team is already
01:10:56.669 cracking and cleaning each one by hand.
01:11:01.382 Gene: And today we probably have about
01:11:03.717 10,000 sea urchins to go through.
01:11:08.013 Narrator: The gonadsare extremely fragile,
01:11:09.890 and they only stay fresh for about a week.
01:11:12.810 Workers crack each urchin down the middle
01:11:14.770 to avoid breaking anyof the gonads inside.
01:11:18.190 Then it's time for oneof the most crucial parts
01:11:20.818 of this process, cleaning the gonads.
01:11:24.822 This stage requires sharpattention to detail.
01:11:27.741 If workers don't totallyremove the intestines
01:11:29.952 inside the urchin, thegonads degrade faster.
01:11:33.330 And if any of the gonadsrip during this process,
01:11:35.874 they immediately drop in value.
01:11:38.085 Gene: If the gonad breaks,then it drops a grade or two.
01:11:42.006 And when it goes from an A-plus-plus grade
01:11:43.841 and we have to drop it down to a B grade,
01:11:46.260 the value is maybe about a quarter
01:11:48.554 of what it could have been.
01:11:50.180 Narrator: Workers thensort the gonads by color,
01:11:52.558 making sure each tray has a uniform shade
01:11:54.935 of yellow or orange.
01:11:57.396 After they've packed each wooden tray,
01:11:59.189 they use tweezers toinspect each gonad again
01:12:02.318 and gently remove any remainingkelp, shells, or spines.
01:12:06.947 The most valuable gonads makeup the A-plus-plus grade.
01:12:10.868 Gene sells a 200-gram premiumtray like this for $100.
01:12:15.873 These uni are bright yellow or orange
01:12:18.125 and come only from thesweeter male urchins.
01:12:21.211 They're primarily sent to restaurants,
01:12:23.881 but Gene doesn't come bythis quality of gonad often.
01:12:27.343 He typically only finds one premium gonad
01:12:29.636 out of every 100 urchins.
01:12:34.641 Sea-urchin gonads weren't always
01:12:36.268 valuable food in the US,particularly in the '70s,
01:12:39.355 just before Gene'sfather opened Tradewind.
01:12:42.358 Gene: The governmentused to ask the divers,
01:12:44.318 the local divers, to smashthem, kill them at the time.
01:12:47.780 Until a Japanese personcame along and said,
01:12:50.157 "No, this is actuallya delicacy in Japan."
01:12:52.951 And after many trials and errors,
01:12:55.412 we also found out thatSanta Barbara sea urchin
01:12:57.498 is actually really, really good,
01:12:59.458 like one of the best in the world.
01:13:02.503 Narrator: Santa Barbara urchin
01:13:03.587 was traditionally shipped to Japan,
01:13:05.714 until economic collapsestalled things in the mid-'90s.
01:13:09.134 Fortunately for Gene's familyand other US producers,
01:13:12.304 a sushi boom took off inthe US around the same time.
01:13:16.183 Gene: Those of us that wasable to make the transition
01:13:18.519 from the Japanese marketinto the US domestic market
01:13:21.772 survived at the time.
01:13:23.816 Narrator: Today, Gene shipshas product across the US.
01:13:27.528 Gene: Uni is one of thefew seafood out there
01:13:31.448 that they really haven'tperfected farming yet.
01:13:34.159 Until somebody figures that out,
01:13:35.911 uni is probably going to be a limited
01:13:38.330 highly sought-after item.
01:13:40.666 Narrator: This ultimately raises the price
01:13:42.376 of rare premium gonads.
01:13:45.671 Gene: This year, we'reactually seeing a good-quality,
01:13:47.714 high-quality uni that wehaven't seen in about a decade.
01:13:50.759 We're seeing a lot more colder waters.
01:13:52.719 We're starting to see kelp grow back
01:13:54.847 where it hasn't grownback in the last 10 years.
01:13:58.225 Narrator: After a difficult decade,
01:13:59.726 things might be lookingup for red sea urchins
01:14:01.979 and the kelp they depend on.
01:14:04.690 Narrator: It takesabout 11 months to craft
01:14:07.025 just one Steinway & Sons grand piano,
01:14:10.237 and these instruments don't come cheap.
01:14:13.115 A Model D concert piano in ebony,
01:14:16.034 the most affordable finishof any Steinway piano,
01:14:19.371 will cost you about $187,000.
01:14:23.000 But that's nowhere nearhow high prices can reach.
01:14:26.962 Steinway has produced
01:14:28.130 two of the most expensivepianos in the world,
01:14:31.300 worth over $2 million each.
01:14:33.969 The next most expensive piano
01:14:35.971 is half the price, at $1.2 million.
01:14:39.766 [drills whirring]
01:14:42.102 But with several otherpremium pianos on the market,
01:14:45.439 is there something aboutSteinway's sound that stands out?
01:14:49.276 And is that what makesthese pianos so expensive?
01:14:56.575 Named the "Rolls-Royceof pianos" by the BBC,
01:15:00.162 Steinway has produced some of the most
01:15:01.788 sought-after grand pianosfor over 160 years.
01:15:06.960 It's the piano of choice for Billy Joel,
01:15:09.046 Lang Lang, and many otherprofessional musicians.
01:15:12.674 But compared to otherhigh-end-piano makers,
01:15:15.385 it's often Steinway'ssound that sets it apart.
01:15:20.516 As a performer, I canwear many different masks,
01:15:23.560 depending on the piece that I'm playing.
01:15:24.978 For some pieces, you wantto be very, very diabolical.
01:15:27.856 You know, enlist.
01:15:29.191 [playing piano]
01:15:34.905 And at the same time, lightness.
01:15:37.241 [playing piano]
01:15:39.785 Narrator: Creating that soundstarts here in New York,
01:15:41.995 at one of only two Steinwayfactories in the world.
01:15:48.085 Each grand piano is 5 to 9 feet long
01:15:50.879 and weighs between 540 and 990 pounds.
01:15:54.800 Often, the bigger the piano,
01:15:56.677 the pricier it will be.
01:15:59.555 About 85% of a Steinwaypiano is made of wood,
01:16:03.183 and one of the most crucial woods
01:16:04.810 is used for the soundboard.
01:16:06.937 The soundboard is thelife of the instrument,
01:16:08.939 the soul of the instrument.
01:16:10.941 This is Alaskan Sitka spruce.
01:16:12.859 This is the most expensive wood
01:16:15.070 that we have in the piano.
01:16:17.072 And we actually get it from the trees,
01:16:19.074 primarily, that are on the shady side,
01:16:21.368 the north-facing side of these islands.
01:16:23.996 So they grow very little each year,
01:16:26.164 and that means that we have growth rings
01:16:28.709 that are very closetogether, not spaced apart.
01:16:32.212 Narrator: Sitka spruce is used
01:16:33.630 in other stringedinstruments, like guitars,
01:16:36.341 and it grows in a fewareas in the Northwest US,
01:16:40.220 but more than 50% of
01:16:41.847 the Alaskan Sitka spruce they source
01:16:44.057 won't meet Steinway's standards.
01:16:46.685 The wood must have a very specific
01:16:48.437 grain density and direction,
01:16:50.689 both which can impactthe quality of sound.
01:16:53.567 Steinway looks for closelypacked, straight grains,
01:16:56.403 no more than plus or minus 15 degrees
01:16:58.697 off a 90-degree vertical grain.
01:17:02.034 There's a reason it'sso strict about this.
01:17:05.037 It's partly why when you pressa key on a Steinway piano,
01:17:08.874 you hear a distinctlylong, sustained tone.
01:17:15.505 The soundboard's edgemust attach perfectly
01:17:17.674 to the piano's rim,
01:17:19.092 the curved wooden frame of the instrument.
01:17:22.304 The full rim is made up
01:17:23.722 of an inner and outer rim.
01:17:26.475 Some piano makers attach
01:17:27.768 each of these pieces separately,
01:17:29.770 but at Steinway,
01:17:30.771 a team of artisans bends both together.
01:17:34.775 Steinway says this method
01:17:36.193 gives the piano a stronger foundation,
01:17:38.779 lowering the chances it will break.
01:17:41.948 Steinway uses hard rock maple
01:17:43.784 for both the inner and outer rims.
01:17:47.412 The key here is to use wood that will,
01:17:49.414 again, allow sound to flow freely.
01:17:52.668 Gilroy: Some companies, as an example,
01:17:54.378 will have hard rock maplefor the outside rim,
01:17:57.047 but the inside rim, to save money,
01:17:58.507 they'll use something like lauan.
01:18:00.384 Lauan is not as dense andhard as hard rock maple.
01:18:05.180 And when you have your soundwaves in that soundboard,
01:18:07.432 some of them are being absorbed
01:18:08.934 a little bit by that lauan,
01:18:10.143 more than they wouldbe by hard rock maple.
01:18:13.689 [testing piano key]
01:18:16.983 Narrator: The consistent touch of the keys
01:18:18.735 is another valuable element
01:18:20.195 unique to each Steinway piano.
01:18:22.447 There are just two artisansin the entire factory
01:18:25.367 trusted with weighing off
01:18:26.660 all 88 keys of every keyboard.
01:18:29.621 This ensures each key is balanced,
01:18:31.998 so a pianist won't have to use more force
01:18:33.875 to press one key over another.
01:18:36.128 Gwendolyn Folk: I used to dreamabout the pianos chasing me.
01:18:38.588 Now, it's not a problem.
01:18:40.257 It's up to -- they the boss.
01:18:43.510 I listen. I pay attention to what it want.
01:18:46.138 The key to it is pay attention
01:18:48.390 and watch that hammer.That's the key to it.
01:18:50.892 Narrator: Each key isconnected to a felt hammer.
01:18:53.228 When pressed, the hammerstrikes the strings
01:18:55.355 to create sound.
01:18:57.524 A key shouldn't respondto the finger's touch
01:18:59.609 too quickly or too slowly.
01:19:02.988 Folk: So, when I go tocheck the return, it stays.
01:19:05.240 You see the hesitation? It's no good.
01:19:07.367 That means it'll stay up in the piano.
01:19:11.037 Do you see how fast that one is?
01:19:13.123 That's too fast, so I take this one away.
01:19:16.418 Then I put this one back,
01:19:18.128 and it wants the small one.
01:19:21.131 You see? So I put the small one,
01:19:23.091 you see how nice it is?
01:19:25.010 And that tells me what it wants.
01:19:27.012 [drills whirring]
01:19:29.681 So that shows you the difference.
01:19:32.934 Every one is different.
01:19:36.271 Narrator: One of the most difficult jobs
01:19:37.856 is the final tone inspection.
01:19:40.692 The goal is to create
01:19:41.651 a balanced tone throughout the piano
01:19:43.653 by slightly adjustingthe hammers as needed.
01:19:46.615 From note to note,
01:19:47.991 we can soften or harden these mallets,
01:19:51.495 or hammers, as we call them,
01:19:53.371 and balance the sound
01:19:55.248 that they generate into the string.
01:19:57.709 Narrator: The quality of a piano's tone
01:19:59.419 is incredibly nuanced,
01:20:01.129 something only anexperienced ear can decipher.
01:20:04.966 Jones: If I take this note
01:20:06.092 [plays note]
01:20:08.261 and then soften it, in this case
01:20:09.846 I will put a needle inthe hammer to soften it,
01:20:13.850 then you'll hear that tone change.
01:20:15.310 [plays note]
01:20:23.443 [plays note]
01:20:25.320 Becomes a little bit smaller.
01:20:27.113 And in increments, small steps,
01:20:29.282 I can go through
01:20:30.826 and find the notes that are too big,
01:20:32.619 too bright, and step them down.
01:20:35.664 [plays piano]
01:20:37.165 Well, I'm 58 and I started when I was 28,
01:20:40.335 so that's 30 years and counting.
01:20:42.170 It's still, I'm stilllearning how to do this.
01:20:44.965 It never stops.
01:20:48.885 Narrator: Like the ways you cancustomize a Rolls-Royce car,
01:20:51.972 you can do similarlywith a Steinway piano.
01:20:56.268 Depending on special additions,
01:20:57.978 veneers, and wood finishes,
01:20:59.938 prices for a singlepiece can reach $500,000,
01:21:03.483 like these pianos designed for Steinway
01:21:05.694 by Lenny Kravitz.
01:21:08.196 In the piano vault underneath the factory,
01:21:10.532 Steinway houses one ofthe most expensive pianos
01:21:13.201 it's ever produced,
01:21:14.536 worth $2.5 million.
01:21:17.998 On average, the priceof a new Steinway piano
01:21:20.584 increases about 4% every year.
01:21:23.795 This is partly because
01:21:24.921 the cost of Alaskan Sitka spruce
01:21:27.090 increases at a higher rate than inflation,
01:21:29.384 according to Steinway.
01:21:32.304 And while the new piecesget more expensive,
01:21:35.223 old ones become more valuable too.
01:21:38.685 A Steinway piano can last several decades
01:21:41.062 with the requiredtouch-ups and restorations.
01:21:44.024 [hammering]
01:21:46.318 A 1965 Steinway Model D piano
01:21:49.237 is worth over $98,000 today.
01:21:52.490 That's more than 13 times
01:21:54.367 what it likely sold for.
01:21:57.162 And although there are several elements
01:21:58.830 that greatly impact the price,
01:22:01.124 it's the musician who ultimately decides
01:22:03.752 what the piano is worth to them.
01:22:07.505 Narrator: This is the mostexpensive fish in Japan.
01:22:10.800 In January 2018,
01:22:12.427 a kilogram of these babyeels cost around $35,000.
01:22:17.098 That's more than bluefin tuna,
01:22:18.850 and almost as much as theprice of gold at the time.
01:22:22.270 But catching these eelsis just the beginning.
01:22:25.148 It can take a year of work
01:22:26.483 until they're large enough to be sold.
01:22:29.486 So what makes these eels so popular?
01:22:32.280 And why are they so expensive?
01:22:37.494 People in Japan have eateneel for thousands of years.
01:22:42.207 Restaurants like thiscan sell 40 to 50 tons
01:22:45.085 of eel each year.
01:22:47.879 Japanese eel, or Anguilla japonica,
01:22:50.757 can be found across East Asia,
01:22:52.926 but overfishing and changing habitats
01:22:55.220 have caused a huge declinein eel populations.
01:22:58.765 Since 1980, the global catch of eel
01:23:00.976 has declined by more than 75%,
01:23:03.687 which has had a huge effect on price.
01:23:21.997 Narrator: Unlike other types of fishing,
01:23:23.373 the majority of eels areraised, not caught as adults.
01:23:28.003 Young eels, called glasseels, are caught in the wild
01:23:30.839 and raised on farms like this.
01:23:34.050 No farms have been able to efficiently
01:23:36.177 breed the eels in captivity.
01:23:38.304 So farmers depend onthe catch of young eels
01:23:40.432 to make a profit.
01:23:54.696 Narrator: Raising this many eels
01:23:56.031 requires constant attention.
01:23:58.783 Michio has been working as an eel farmer
01:24:00.744 for almost 40 years.
01:24:25.018 Narrator: After the costof the eels themselves,
01:24:27.228 feeding them is the most expensive part.
01:24:33.985 Two to three times a day,workers feed eels this.
01:24:38.073 It's a mixture of fish meal, wheat,
01:24:40.325 soybean meal, and fish oil.
01:25:18.363 Narrator: After six to 12 months of work,
01:25:20.031 eels are big enough to be sold.
01:25:24.994 Workers unload the eelsand sort them by size
01:25:27.330 to determine where they'll be sold.
01:25:29.833 Experienced workers canquickly tell the difference
01:25:32.293 just by feel.
01:25:35.296 Some of these eels willend up at restaurants
01:25:37.340 like Surugaya, which has been serving eel
01:25:39.926 for over 150 years.
01:25:42.595 That high demand is part of the reason
01:25:44.514 young eels are so expensive.
01:25:47.475 The final dish is called kabayaki.
01:25:50.562 It may look simple,
01:25:51.855 but preparing it takes years to master.
01:26:10.081 Narrator: Workers prepare eelalive to maintain freshness,
01:26:13.543 but this makes handlingmuch more difficult.
01:26:17.172 Workers remove the bones and cut eels
01:26:19.174 to the proper size for the skewers.
01:26:31.853 Narrator: Eel has tobe constantly monitored
01:26:33.646 while it's cooking toachieve even grilling.
01:26:43.573 Narrator: Chefs steam, thengrill each eel three times,
01:26:46.993 dipping it into saucebetween each grilling.
01:27:02.717 Narrator: Kabayakipresented in a lacquer box
01:27:04.802 with rice is called unajū.
01:27:07.305 It can cost up to $91 dependingon the price of adult eel.
01:27:11.809 If prices are too high,
01:27:13.353 restaurants struggle to make a profit.
01:27:32.330 Narrator: In Japan, eelsare eaten year-round,
01:27:35.250 but consumption peaks in the summer,
01:27:37.377 and it's become a big partof some local economies.
01:27:40.713 But the high demand has caused concern.
01:27:43.341 In 2014, Japanese eels wereclassified as endangered,
01:27:47.887 and because of low domestic catch,
01:27:50.014 the majority of eels eaten in Japan
01:27:52.267 are imported from China and Taiwan.
01:28:17.458 Narrator: There havebeen efforts to improve
01:28:19.127 the eel population,like regulating fishing,
01:28:22.297 releasing adult eels back into the water,
01:28:24.924 and researching how tohatch eels in farms.
01:28:28.136 But the future of Japaneseeels remains unclear,
01:28:31.472 and the price is likelyto increase with demand.
01:28:36.269 Do you recognize this photo?
01:28:38.771 What about these?
01:28:40.898 They were all taken witha Hasselblad camera.
01:28:44.110 It's a name every photographer knows.
01:28:46.988 But if you wanted to buythis Hasselblad camera,
01:28:50.033 you'd need over $30,000.
01:28:52.618 And that doesn't even include the lens.
01:28:55.413 So why would anyone payso much for a camera?
01:28:59.167 And what makes Hasselblads so expensive?
01:29:03.671 To understand why peoplelove Hasselblad cameras,
01:29:06.674 it helps to look at this image.
01:29:08.968 If you zoom way in,
01:29:10.094 you can see incredible detail.
01:29:12.680 The photos are fantastic,
01:29:14.640 but it's a little morecomplicated than that.
01:29:17.685 Hasselblad has been makingcameras for 80 years,
01:29:20.772 but they weren't always this expensive.
01:29:23.316 In 1948, Hasselblad'sfirst consumer camera
01:29:26.277 cost around $500,
01:29:28.112 or about $5,900 today.
01:29:31.074 And, adjusted for inflation,
01:29:33.076 its film cameras from the '70s
01:29:34.619 cost around $5,300.
01:29:37.121 But when the companytransitioned to digital,
01:29:39.457 the price exploded.
01:29:41.501 In 2004, Hasselblad's first digital camera
01:29:44.504 sold for around $24,000.
01:29:47.548 That was more than a 200% price increase
01:29:50.343 from its previous model, which used film.
01:29:53.763 OK, so it's expensive.
01:29:55.807 But what actually makesthis camera different?
01:29:59.727 Hasselblad's high-end cameras
01:30:01.187 consist of three main parts,
01:30:03.731 the digital back, the body, and the lens.
01:30:06.692 Just the digital back,
01:30:07.985 which includes the sensor,
01:30:09.445 costs over $26,000.
01:30:12.323 Rudnickas: The Hasselblad sensor is unique
01:30:14.617 in a way that it's much larger in area.
01:30:18.371 The individual pixel is bigger,
01:30:21.374 and that provides a lower noise
01:30:24.210 and wider dynamic range.
01:30:26.170 Narrator: Take a look atthis photo of a motorcycle.
01:30:28.214 When you zoom in,
01:30:29.465 you can clearly see thetexture of the handle
01:30:32.009 and the wear on its tires.
01:30:34.512 Larger sensors capture more detail,
01:30:36.764 and Hasselblad's is oneof the biggest available.
01:30:40.059 Its cameras are what'scalled medium format.
01:30:42.728 Basically, it means the sensor is big,
01:30:45.440 and it's what makes thesecameras so expensive.
01:30:48.192 Your smartphone camerasensor is around this big.
01:30:51.654 A popular professional camera,
01:30:53.406 like the Sony A7R, is much larger.
01:30:56.659 But it looks tiny comparedto Hasselblad's sensor.
01:31:00.204 Rudnickas: When medium-format technology
01:31:02.582 transitioned from analog to digital,
01:31:05.626 the medium-format sensorsbecame extremely expensive
01:31:10.131 and the camera systems became
01:31:11.466 extremely expensive and very niche.
01:31:14.760 Narrator: The sensor in this camera
01:31:16.304 is actually made by Sony,
01:31:18.431 but Hasselblad has its own
01:31:19.891 proprietary calibration process
01:31:21.934 to achieve the colors andimage quality it wants.
01:31:25.688 Rudnickas: It's veryuseful for the skin tones
01:31:28.316 or the reproduction of artwork,
01:31:30.568 where you really need to make sure
01:31:33.154 that the colors you have in real life
01:31:35.573 are the ones that will end up
01:31:37.200 later in the photographs.
01:31:39.452 Narrator: Medium-formatcameras are mainly used
01:31:41.454 for product and fashion photography
01:31:43.664 as well as art reproduction.
01:31:45.958 Photographers who need this type
01:31:47.210 of specialized technology
01:31:48.669 can't use off-the-shelf consumer cameras.
01:31:51.380 And these shoots usuallytake place in a studio,
01:31:53.925 where the camera's bulkysize isn't an issue.
01:31:57.136 But there's another factor
01:31:58.179 that makes Hasselblad cameras unique.
01:32:00.723 Unlike other companies,
01:32:02.099 Hasselblad doesn'tmass-produce its cameras.
01:32:04.810 It makes them in smallbatches assembled by hand.
01:32:08.606 This is partly because Hasselblad
01:32:10.274 doesn't make that many cameras.
01:32:12.652 Hasselblad doesn't disclose
01:32:13.986 exactly how many cameras it makes,
01:32:16.364 but in 2018, The Verge reported
01:32:18.533 that Hasselblad's yearly production
01:32:20.243 was under 10,000 units.
01:32:22.703 Other manufacturers, like Canon,
01:32:24.705 produce millions of cameras each year.
01:32:27.750 But this process also ensures
01:32:29.418 that each camera meetsHasselblad's quality standards.
01:32:32.838 Gorges: Here in production,we have people that
01:32:34.674 work here for over 30 years.
01:32:36.926 And for special tasks,
01:32:40.179 we have people that,they just do that task.
01:32:42.306 Nobody else can do that.
01:32:45.768 Narrator: Hasselbladassembles its cameras here,
01:32:47.979 in Gothenburg, Sweden.
01:32:49.897 Remember this old photo?
01:32:51.899 Production today looks pretty similar.
01:32:54.735 Its facility is more like a lab
01:32:56.654 than an assembly line.
01:32:58.489 Here, each component is tested,
01:33:00.449 connected, and soldered.
01:33:02.994 But learning how to adjusteach part isn't easy.
01:33:07.790 Assemblers rely on bothprecise instruments
01:33:10.459 and the sound and feel of each component
01:33:12.837 to know that it's working properly.
01:33:15.506 My favorite part is the mirror assembly,
01:33:20.428 this part.
01:33:21.679 [part clicking]
01:33:22.930 I know that's not workingwell because of the click.
01:33:25.433 You have to work here maybe,
01:33:27.059 just assembling these parts,
01:33:28.603 maybe months until you'recapable of making it right.
01:33:33.608 Narrator: When you charge$30,000 for a camera,
01:33:35.985 quality control is a top priority.
01:33:38.446 And assemblers taketheir job very seriously.
01:33:41.907 Gorges: The whole processrequires a lot of patience.
01:33:44.076 You will end up learningto be very careful
01:33:46.412 while mounting these tiny parts.
01:33:47.997 Otherwise, you will runinto different issues
01:33:50.207 afterwards while testing the camera.
01:33:53.169 Narrator: Assemblers complete a camera
01:33:54.629 in around six to eight hours.
01:33:56.756 But calibration can takeup to a third of that time.
01:34:00.468 Rudnickas: What's uniqueabout Hasselblad cameras
01:34:03.346 is that each sensor
01:34:05.640 is individually calibrated and tested
01:34:09.018 to a single pixel level,
01:34:11.020 which is very time-consuming
01:34:12.688 and quite unique in this industry.
01:34:16.108 Narrator: But pressure to deliver
01:34:17.318 consumer-focused cameras has increased.
01:34:20.488 In the past few years,Hasselblad has released
01:34:22.865 more affordable cameras, around $6,000.
01:34:26.285 These cameras have a smaller sensor
01:34:28.037 compared to other more expensive models.
01:34:30.790 But competition in thisprice range is steep.
01:34:33.793 Sony's latest Alpha 1camera costs a bit more,
01:34:36.629 but it can shoot 8K video
01:34:38.255 and has superfast autofocus.
01:34:40.966 And while the sensors oncheaper cameras aren't as large,
01:34:44.011 those cameras pack more features
01:34:45.388 that appeal to a widerange of photographers.
01:34:48.557 Hasselblad says thatit's working to introduce
01:34:50.768 more entry-level medium-format cameras
01:34:53.479 but that it will continue to support
01:34:55.022 its high-end customers.
01:34:57.566 And for many photographers
01:34:58.776 who need uncompromising image quality,
01:35:01.529 this Hasselblad continuesto be worth the price.
01:35:08.577 Narrator: Just one 2.5-kilogram durian
01:35:11.038 from Nonthaburi, Thailand, can cost $380.
01:35:15.251 Yet the fruit has a smell
01:35:16.544 that some people findextremely unpleasant.
01:35:19.880 In fact, durian is banned
01:35:21.465 in several airports andhotels around the world.
01:35:24.844 But in Asia and the Pacific Islands,
01:35:26.887 durian is known as the "King of Fruit."
01:35:29.682 In 2019, one Nonthaburi durian
01:35:32.101 sold at auction for $48,000.
01:35:35.646 So, what draws people tothis pungent, spiky fruit?
01:35:39.191 And why is it so expensive?
01:35:43.446 Thailand is expected to harvest
01:35:45.406 almost 1 million metrictons of durian in 2021.
01:35:49.744 Durian is native toseveral tropical climates
01:35:52.037 around the world, including Thailand.
01:35:54.582 Thailand alone grows over 300 varieties,
01:35:57.334 but the most expensive durians
01:35:58.961 are grown in Nonthaburi Province.
01:36:01.005 They're known as Nont durian.
01:36:03.632 Nont makes up the highestgrade of durian in Thailand
01:36:06.010 and is often given as a token of respect.
01:36:08.763 But even among Nont durians,two varieties stand out:
01:36:12.850 the most expensive, Kan Yao durian,
01:36:15.269 and the slightly moreaffordable Mon Thong durian.
01:36:35.998 Narrator: Nont durianis described as having
01:36:37.833 refined and sweet pulp
01:36:39.585 with a mild fragrance and creamy texture,
01:36:42.338 whereas other lesser-grade durians
01:36:44.131 are said to have a strongersmell and a watery texture.
01:36:48.177 Nont durian has a distinct taste and smell
01:36:50.638 for two main reasons:Nonthaburi's environment
01:36:53.849 and the growing practices of its farmers.
01:36:56.811 Nonthaburi Province has beena center for durian farming
01:36:59.939 in Thailand for over 300 years.
01:37:02.817 Farmers in this region havebeen honing their technique
01:37:05.361 for generations, usingtheir resources and skill
01:37:08.489 to grow the highest-qualitydurians possible.
01:37:11.784 One of the resources they depend on
01:37:13.869 is the Chao Phraya River,
01:37:15.621 which flows through Nonthaburi
01:37:17.248 and fertilizes the soil.
01:37:35.891 Narrator: But the river water isn't used
01:37:37.393 to water the durian trees themselves.
01:37:40.020 Farmers in Nonthaburiprefer to buy fresh water,
01:37:42.731 which they believe improves thefinal quality of the durian.
01:38:16.974 Narrator: After planting,it takes about six years
01:38:19.226 for a healthy durian tree to bear fruit.
01:38:22.271 Once the trees start to flower,
01:38:24.189 farmers count the daysuntil the fruits are ripe.
01:38:27.818 Depending on the breed,
01:38:29.069 this can span 90 to 150 days.
01:38:32.656 But it's not only the time and labor
01:38:34.575 that make Nont durian so pricey.
01:38:37.077 The costs to providethis kind of care add up.
01:38:40.372 Just the water costsabout $2,200 per year.
01:39:04.271 Narrator: Farmers have toconstantly check the trees
01:39:06.440 and look for any infections or insects,
01:39:09.193 and they wrap each durianin plastic to protect it.
01:39:12.863 They must harvest the durians one by one,
01:39:15.449 when each fruit is perfectly ripe.
01:39:32.967 Narrator: These time-consuming
01:39:34.134 and labor-intensivetechniques have a major impact
01:39:37.096 on the flavor and finalvalue of Nont durian.
01:39:41.100 A 2.5-kilogram Mon Thong durian
01:39:43.227 from Apiranya Farm can cost over $100.
01:39:47.439 That's about a third ofthe price of Kan Yao,
01:39:49.900 making it a more popular
01:39:51.276 and affordable option for customers.
01:40:16.760 Narrator: Kan Yao, on the other hand,
01:40:18.220 is the most expensiveNont durian you can buy.
01:40:21.724 Depending on its size,
01:40:23.267 Kan Yao durians from Apiranya Farm
01:40:25.436 can range from about$380 to $530 per fruit.
01:40:30.774 But despite Kan Yao's steep price,
01:40:33.235 demand for this variety is growing.
01:40:35.654 And supply can't keep up.
01:41:01.346 Narrator: One of the main challenges
01:41:02.639 is the climate crisis.
01:41:33.253 Narrator: The tropical climate required
01:41:34.630 to grow durian also makesthe farms susceptible
01:41:37.758 to floods, storms, andother extreme weather.
01:41:41.303 In 1995 and 2011, floods destroyed
01:41:44.765 almost all of the duriantrees in Nonthaburi.
01:41:47.643 In 2011, about 1,100 acresof durian trees were leveled,
01:41:52.106 and only 17 acres survived.
01:41:55.275 After this, Benjamat had tostart the six-year process over.
01:42:16.338 Narrator: The global market for durian
01:42:17.923 is expected to reachover $28 billion by 2025.
01:42:22.886 And that means Apiranyaand other Nonthaburi farms
01:42:26.598 will likely continueselling out of Nont durian
01:42:29.226 in the years to come.
01:42:35.482 Narrator: The first thing you notice
01:42:36.483 about Japanese Ruby Romangrapes is their size.
01:42:43.115 Just one is about four timesthe size of an average grape.
01:42:48.954 But inspectors look even closer.
01:42:52.082 If the color of these grapes
01:42:53.375 matches categories threeor four on this color card,
01:42:57.212 then just one bunch couldsell for $90 to $450.
01:43:02.134 But size and color are justtwo of the characteristics
01:43:05.304 that define these luxury grapes.
01:43:08.724 So what else do inspectors look for?
01:43:11.310 And why are these grapes so expensive?
01:43:39.213 Narrator: In Japanese culture,
01:43:40.422 fruits are considereda luxury and gift item.
01:43:44.009 In fact, Japanese supermarketsoften won't sell fruits
01:43:47.346 if they have any blemishesor aren't the right shape.
01:43:51.975 Inspectors like Kazuyoshi Sakuraiuse very specific criteria
01:43:56.313 to scrutinize each grain,or individual grape,
01:43:59.650 that grows in Kahoku city.
01:44:27.010 Narrator: Superior-grade grapes
01:44:28.553 make up almost 90% of the harvest,
01:44:31.098 and Special Superiorgrapes make up about 10%.
01:44:35.602 Superior bunches can costbetween $90 and $140.
01:44:40.107 Special Superior grapes are priced at $180
01:44:42.943 to as high as $450.
01:44:45.946 But there's still one categoryhigher than these two.
01:45:07.634 Narrator: Only one or two bunches a year
01:45:10.012 qualify as Premium in Kahoku.
01:45:12.472 Farmers hope to sell onebunch of Premium grapes
01:45:15.142 for over $1,000.
01:45:17.728 Two bunches made the cut this year,
01:45:19.896 but in 2019 and 2020,
01:45:22.107 no grapes qualified forthe Premium category.
01:45:26.653 No matter the grade, though,
01:45:28.196 all Ruby Roman grapes havea uniquely sweet flavor,
01:45:31.366 according to Isu.
01:46:09.237 Narrator: Harvesting starts in July,
01:46:10.906 just in time for one of two
01:46:12.783 main Japanese gift-giving holidays,
01:46:15.077 Ochugen.
01:46:19.748 The grapes are only grownin Ishikawa Prefecture,
01:46:23.126 and they're cultivated in greenhouses,
01:46:25.295 where farmers have bettercontrol over the growing process.
01:46:28.507 Each grape is monitored and manicured,
01:46:31.218 so that every one in a bunchlooks totally identical.
01:46:35.722 To produce grapes of the proper size,
01:46:38.058 they use a grape-thinning device
01:46:39.976 and a simple pair of scissors.
01:47:03.834 Narrator: The second factorthey control is light.
01:47:18.807 Narrator: One way to control light
01:47:19.933 is by adding or removingleaves near the vines.
01:47:22.936 To confirm that enough lightis getting into the greenhouse,
01:47:25.522 farmers use a different tool.
01:47:43.540 Narrator: Using a program they developed
01:47:44.583 with a private IT company,
01:47:46.293 farmers can then identify how much light
01:47:48.420 they need to add or subtract.
01:48:15.030 Narrator: The final complicated element
01:48:17.115 for Ruby Roman grapefarmers is temperature.
01:48:39.763 Narrator: They open the sides and ceilings
01:48:41.556 of the greenhouse
01:48:42.474 to keep it as cool andventilated as possible.
01:48:48.063 And still, not all the RubyRoman grapes farmers grow
01:48:51.816 will be up to standard.
01:48:53.568 Which is why supply isconsistently limited.
01:48:56.947 In 2020, only 25,000 RubyRoman bunches were up for sale.
01:49:02.077 That's a tiny fraction ofJapan's yearly grape production,
01:49:05.914 which was about 163,000 tons in 2020.
01:49:11.836 It wasn't until 2008
01:49:13.797 that the first Ruby Romangrapes went up for sale.
01:49:18.051 The effort to create them started in 1995
01:49:21.471 when local grape farmers
01:49:22.889 and Ishikawa's AgriculturalResearch Center
01:49:25.684 came together to develop anew breed of large red grape.
01:50:12.772 Narrator: What they ended up with
01:50:13.732 is the most expensive grape in the world.
01:50:16.776 So expensive that in 2020,
01:50:18.945 one bunch of these grapes sold at auction
01:50:21.031 for $12,000.
01:50:23.158 That's about $400 per grape.
01:50:27.912 Narrator: If a single hair is out of place
01:50:30.081 on a high-end calligraphy brush,
01:50:32.292 it must be removed.
01:50:34.544 This intense attention to detail
01:50:36.421 is part of why these brushescan cost over $1,000.
01:50:40.675 You can find a beginnerbrush for less than $15,
01:50:44.137 but for handmade brushes custom-designed
01:50:46.598 for a master calligrapher,
01:50:48.600 artisans spend months
01:50:49.976 turning raw hair into a perfect brush tip.
01:50:54.189 But what makes these brushes unique?
01:50:57.525 And why are they so expensive?
01:51:03.323 Calligraphy is a respectedart form in Japan
01:51:06.451 and has been practiced for centuries.
01:51:09.537 But today, there aren't manyskilled brushmakers left.
01:51:14.417 Yoshiyuki Hata is athird-generation brushmaker
01:51:17.671 and has been making calligraphy brushes
01:51:19.381 since he was a teenager.
01:51:32.477 Narrator: His family'sworkshop in Kawajiri focuses on
01:51:35.021 what they call "no-compromisecraftsmanship."
01:51:38.441 Each brush tip is handmadeby a single artisan.
01:51:42.404 But making these brushes isn't easy.
01:51:52.831 Narrator: For a mastercalligrapher, like Daizo Kaneko,
01:51:55.875 small differences in a brush'shardness or ink retention
01:51:59.671 can drastically affectthe lines it can produce.
01:52:24.404 Narrator: The dozens ofsteps involved in brushmaking
01:52:26.865 start with selecting the hair.
01:52:29.367 Different types of hair have a big impact
01:52:31.619 on the price of a brush.
01:52:33.705 Yoshiyuki's specialtyis one of the priciest:
01:52:36.666 goat hair.
01:52:38.168 This hair was collected 50 years ago
01:52:40.545 from the chest of YangtzeRiver Delta white goats.
01:52:44.340 Hair from this specific breed of goat
01:52:46.509 is classified as Type III hair,
01:52:48.970 based on its size, luster, and elasticity.
01:52:52.515 It's a highly sought-afterhair for brushmaking
01:52:55.226 because it's soft, yet durable
01:52:57.437 and retains ink well.
01:53:13.661 Narrator: But today, this type of hair
01:53:15.330 is hard to find in large quantities
01:53:17.624 and can cost thousandsof dollars per kilogram.
01:53:21.669 Selecting high-quality hairis done entirely by eye,
01:53:25.799 and it's one of the hardest skills
01:53:27.342 for a new brushmaker to learn.
01:53:45.819 Narrator: But this longprocess is just beginning.
01:53:49.489 Once the hairs are chosen,
01:53:50.949 they're boiled and combedto remove any fluff.
01:53:54.160 This process separatesstraight, long hairs,
01:53:57.080 which are ideal for brushmaking.
01:53:59.999 One of the most time-consuming steps
01:54:02.043 is aligning all of these hairs.
01:54:05.088 This delicate work is keyto making a uniform brush,
01:54:09.175 but it's largely based onexperience and instinct.
01:54:23.857 Narrator: Throughout the process,
01:54:24.983 brushmakers patiently removeany imperfect or damaged hairs.
01:55:21.164 Narrator: At this stage,Yoshiyuki's vision
01:55:23.374 for a brush starts to take shape.
01:55:27.045 After trimming, he wets the hair
01:55:29.088 and combines different bundles
01:55:30.673 to create a brush thatis dense and durable.
01:55:37.388 Then he dips the hair in funori,
01:55:39.474 an adhesive liquid made from seaweed,
01:55:41.893 to hold the hairs together.
01:56:02.580 Narrator: The finished brush tip
01:56:03.706 is almost unrecognizablefrom the raw hair.
01:56:07.043 But the precise work isn't over yet.
01:56:11.464 Once the hair dries,Yoshiyuki ties up the ends
01:56:14.509 and burns each one with a hot iron,
01:56:17.011 binding the hairs together.
01:56:20.056 Any mistake here couldruin a month of work.
01:56:27.021 Finally, it's time to assemble the brush.
01:56:30.400 Like the brush tip, eachhandle is custom-made.
01:56:50.169 Narrator: This time-consuming process,
01:56:51.963 along with the materials used,
01:56:53.965 means these brushescan cost 100 times more
01:56:56.843 than a mass-produced brush.
01:56:59.554 The price varies based onthe size and type of brush.
01:57:03.182 A larger brush requires more hair,
01:57:05.476 which naturally increases the price.
01:57:08.521 Hata Bunshindou brushesoften cost around $1,300,
01:57:12.859 but some brushes can cost a lot more.
01:57:25.329 Narrator: Despite the high price,
01:57:26.914 these brushes are essential tools
01:57:28.708 for calligraphers like Daizo.
01:57:31.169 He followed in the footstepsof his father and grandfather
01:57:34.172 and has been practicingcalligraphy for 20 years.
01:58:08.206 Narrator: Some brushmakersmix natural and synthetic hair
01:58:11.125 to make brushes more affordable.
01:58:13.294 But Yoshiyuki remains committed
01:58:15.171 to using only thehighest-quality materials.
01:58:19.342 Koso, Yoshiyuki's son,will be the workshop's
01:58:22.053 fourth-generation brushmaker.
01:58:43.950 Narrator: But like manytraditional crafts,
01:58:45.785 the future of brushmaking is unclear.
01:58:49.205 Demand for handmade brushes is in decline.
01:58:52.375 Some brushmakers have startedselling makeup brushes
01:58:54.877 to bring in new customers.
01:58:57.171 But the main concern forYoshiyuki and his family
01:59:00.133 is the lack of raw materials.
01:59:33.833 Narrator: In the remoteforests of Northeastern China,
01:59:36.794 local harvesters climbtrees as high as 100 feet
01:59:40.339 to reach this region'smost valuable product.
01:59:45.261 Pine nuts.
01:59:49.348 The job is dangerous,but the reward is high
01:59:52.768 for people willing to risk their lives.
01:59:57.440 In the US, pine nuts,which are actually seeds,
02:00:00.943 can sell for upwards of $117 a kilogram.
02:00:05.198 Compare that to the price of pistachios,
02:00:07.909 which can sell for about $39 a kilogram.
02:00:12.205 So what makes pine nuts so special,
02:00:14.790 and why are they so expensive?
02:00:19.295 Around the world, there are 30 species
02:00:21.422 of pine trees that produce edible seeds.
02:00:24.175 Yet only a handful are sold commercially,
02:00:27.178 like Korean pine, which growshere in Northeastern China.
02:00:31.849 It needs specific conditions to grow,
02:00:34.477 and unlike almonds and pecans,
02:00:36.312 which can be commercially grown
02:00:37.563 on orchards and plantations,
02:00:39.732 most pine nuts come from natural forests.
02:00:42.860 The trees need to grow forat least 25 to 50 years
02:00:46.906 before they bear cones and seeds.
02:00:50.743 Even after all this time,
02:00:52.912 individual trees willonly be ripe for picking
02:00:55.790 once every two years.
02:01:00.628 When the time comes, local harvesters
02:01:02.797 make their way into the forest
02:01:04.215 to do the most dangerous part of the job
02:01:06.467 the moment they arrive:
02:01:08.094 scaling those 100-foot trees
02:01:10.096 to reach the cones and seeds.
02:01:21.399 Narrator: Those who are willing
02:01:22.817 climb 20 to 30 trees each day,
02:01:25.361 armed with long poles
02:01:27.029 and spikes attached to their boots,
02:01:29.115 which they use to knock thecones to the forest floor.
02:01:56.809 Narrator: Because of the risk,
02:01:58.019 and because this jobcan't be done by machines,
02:02:00.855 processors must also payfor accident insurance.
02:02:04.275 It costs about 900 yuan, or $139,
02:02:07.987 per worker each month.
02:02:10.197 And insurance costsget even more expensive
02:02:12.450 for harvesting companies whenpaying for workers by the day.
02:02:33.304 Narrator: Another unpredictable element
02:02:34.972 of harvesting pine nuts
02:02:36.349 is just how much time harvesters have
02:02:38.601 to collect the pine cones each season.
02:02:41.645 For example, the Korean pine season
02:02:43.898 typically starts on September 1
02:02:46.108 and can last as long as two months
02:02:47.943 or be as short as 20 days.
02:02:51.197 This brief window of time means laborers
02:02:53.407 have to collect as many cones as possible
02:02:55.743 into their large burlap sacks.
02:02:58.245 On average, they can fillfour to six bags a day,
02:03:01.582 with a single sack oftenweighing as much as 142 pounds.
02:03:07.755 They get paid by processors in two ways.
02:03:10.549 First, they earn a day rate,
02:03:12.093 which is around $123 a day.
02:03:14.845 And second, they get paidby how much they harvest.
02:03:17.765 As of September 2021, aprocessor will pay $720
02:03:22.061 for four full bags of cones.
02:03:25.189 These bags then go toa processing facility,
02:03:29.610 where the cones are opened and crushed
02:03:31.362 to reveal the pine nut shells inside.
02:03:37.243 Cones that are sold to processors
02:03:38.786 often come in green and unripened
02:03:40.913 and need additional processing.
02:04:24.081 Narrator: Knowing exactly when a pine cone
02:04:25.958 needs to be threshed
02:04:27.001 is an important part of the process,
02:04:29.086 as it can determine thequality of the seeds inside
02:04:32.214 and ultimately the finalprice they can be sold for.
02:05:00.701 Narrator: It's only after thepine cone scales are opened
02:05:03.329 that the pine nuts can be extracted,
02:05:05.539 and even then, the conesdon't yield many seeds.
02:05:18.219 Narrator: This means that250 kilograms of pine cones
02:05:21.639 yields only 50 kilograms of pine nuts.
02:05:25.684 Because a majority of pinetrees grow in natural forests,
02:05:28.646 there are large variations inthe yield from year to year.
02:05:32.149 This causes demand tooften outweigh supply,
02:05:34.860 driving the overall price of pine nuts up.
02:05:38.489 But the price of each pinenut also depends on its size.
02:05:58.634 Narrator: Once processed,some seeds are sold
02:06:00.928 as they are now, in their shells.
02:06:02.972 Others are sold as the white nuts
02:06:04.515 you see in dishes like pesto.
02:06:06.850 They're the same nuts,
02:06:08.060 just with the outer shell removed.
02:06:11.272 The two largest producers of pine nuts
02:06:13.566 are East Asia and the Mediterranean.
02:06:15.985 Korean pine, which isthe most common species
02:06:18.445 to grow in China,
02:06:19.697 makes up 59% of the world's global supply.
02:06:23.826 By 2025, the pine nut market
02:06:26.161 is expected to grow by $332 million.
02:06:31.125 And with a growing demand
02:06:32.543 for foods like pesto and hummus,
02:06:35.087 it's likely that the priceyou pay for pine nuts
02:06:37.381 will only continue to rise.
02:06:42.011 Narrator: Green cardamom is one of the
02:06:43.554 most expensive spices in the world.
02:06:46.682 Just 1 kilogram of it can sell for $90.
02:06:50.436 But getting that littlebit of green cardamom
02:06:52.730 requires a lot of work.
02:06:55.065 Harvesters need to collect 6 kilograms
02:06:57.401 of these small raw pods by hand
02:06:59.862 to produce just 1 kilogram of the spice.
02:07:03.282 So, why is it so hardto grow green cardamom?
02:07:06.577 And is that what makes it so expensive?
02:07:12.499 Known as the "queen of spices,"
02:07:14.585 cardamom comes from smalloval-shaped fruits called pods,
02:07:18.672 which contain several black seeds inside.
02:07:21.717 Those seeds are what give green cardamom
02:07:23.636 its uniquely citrusy,sweet flavor and aroma.
02:07:27.848 The green cardamom plant
02:07:28.891 grows in select regions around the world,
02:07:31.310 but it especially thrivesin India's Idukki district,
02:07:34.897 where Raja's family hasgrown the spice for 30 years.
02:07:39.401 After cardamom is planted,
02:07:40.903 farmers must wait three yearsfor the plants to mature.
02:07:44.573 When that waiting period is finally over,
02:07:46.909 workers have most of the year,
02:07:48.410 from July to next February, to harvest.
02:07:51.372 While that's a long harvesting period,
02:07:53.499 not all of the pods can beharvested at the same time.
02:07:57.336 And knowing precisely when to harvest
02:07:59.463 is a job for highly skilled workers.
02:08:34.039 Narrator: To do the job right,
02:08:35.332 harvesters train for six months
02:08:37.042 alongside experienced farmers.
02:08:39.712 This is when they learn to decipher
02:08:41.463 a ripe fruit that can be picked
02:08:43.632 versus a raw pod that isnot yet ready to harvest.
02:08:51.306 Narrator: In the end, theplant doesn't yield much.
02:08:54.476 Farmers harvest a maximumof 10 pods, on average,
02:08:57.855 from each plant.
02:08:59.565 That number of pods produces
02:09:01.066 only about 1.5 teaspoonsof ground cardamom.
02:09:05.237 But harvesting is just the beginning.
02:09:07.990 Only after the pods are dried
02:09:09.783 will they look like the greencardamom sold in stores.
02:09:13.287 You can buy cardamom pods,
02:09:15.164 just the black seeds,
02:09:16.498 or ground cardamom, which arethe seeds in powdered form.
02:09:21.462 All of the pods headto a separate location
02:09:23.589 to dry for about 18 hours
02:09:25.758 within a day or so after harvesting.
02:09:28.969 Any delay will cause the pods
02:09:30.471 to decay and lose flavor.
02:09:34.016 Drying also preserves thespice's green color —
02:09:37.019 a factor that directly impactshow valuable a pod will be
02:09:40.606 and what it will be used for.
02:09:51.575 Narrator: From here, thepods are cleaned and sorted.
02:09:55.871 Workers use their handsto push and separate
02:09:58.123 the smaller, lower-qualitypods through the holes.
02:10:03.420 Each pod is then graded
02:10:04.838 based on its size, weight, and color.
02:10:07.716 Highly valued pods are bigger,greener, and full of seeds.
02:10:12.095 Out of all the cardamom Raja harvests,
02:10:14.515 the majority won't be worth very much.
02:10:17.434 In fact, only a sixth will qualify
02:10:20.187 as good-quality, marketable cardamom.
02:10:37.329 Narrator: Some exportedwhole green cardamom pods
02:10:39.289 from other producers can be even costlier,
02:10:42.376 retailing for over four times the price,
02:10:44.753 at $90 per kilogram.
02:10:47.714 The company's lowest gradecosts 900 Indian rupees,
02:10:51.134 or about $12, per kilogram
02:10:53.679 and can be sold as ground cardamom.
02:10:57.099 Pods with any sign of discoloration or rot
02:10:59.977 aren't marketable and willtherefore be rejected.
02:11:20.247 Narrator: But this whole process
02:11:21.331 could be totally disruptedby changes in weather.
02:11:25.711 If there's too muchrain, the pods will rot.
02:11:29.006 If there's not enough,they'll burn out from the sun.
02:11:32.926 More recently, the world's climate crisis
02:11:35.220 and unpredictable weather
02:11:36.471 in India's Idukki district specifically
02:11:38.974 have hurt supplies of green cardamom.
02:11:42.185 The district makes up at leasta sixth of global production
02:11:45.272 and roughly three-quarters
02:11:46.607 of India's green cardamom production.
02:11:49.276 But its supply took a hit in recent years,
02:11:51.945 as harsh weather and rainsruined farmers' crops.
02:11:56.074 This drove up the pricesof cardamom in 2019
02:11:59.286 but didn't necessarilybenefit small farmers.
02:12:02.956 In order to make a huge profit,
02:12:04.791 farmers need a large inventory.
02:12:07.252 And when cardamom is sold insmall amounts by small farmers,
02:12:10.881 most of the payment is used
02:12:12.215 to cover the cost of production only.
02:12:16.011 Raja spends about 15,000 Indian rupees,
02:12:19.097 or about $200, per acrejust on fertilizer.
02:12:23.477 That's between 10% and 15%
02:12:25.979 of the total profitshe'll make off that acre.
02:12:29.566 And those profits oftendon't cover the total
02:12:32.277 Raja must spend on production.
02:13:04.434 Narrator: All this considered,the global cardamom market
02:13:06.895 is expected to grow by about $169 million
02:13:10.774 between 2021 and 2025.
02:13:14.444 This is good for the industry
02:13:16.238 but could present a challenge
02:13:17.406 for farmers unable to meet demand
02:13:19.866 as the climate crisiscontinues to threaten
02:13:21.994 the supply of this coveted spice.
02:13:27.249 Narrator: A Stetsoncowboy hat is stretched,
02:13:29.501 shrunk, and submerged in waterbefore it fully takes form.
02:13:35.424 Those are only a few stagesin the two-day process
02:13:38.468 that can make these hats so costly.
02:13:41.638 You won't find the popular Skyline style
02:13:44.099 for less than $245 on Stetson's website.
02:13:48.812 That's little compared to this one,
02:13:50.522 which will set you back $5,000.
02:13:54.151 But it's not just how these hats are made.
02:13:56.862 Stetson is one of the few hat brands
02:13:58.739 that have reached icon status.
02:14:01.366 So what made Stetson so iconic?
02:14:04.119 And is that why thesehats are so expensive?
02:14:17.382 Producing a Stetson cowboy hat
02:14:18.884 is a complicated and costly process.
02:14:21.928 The production beginshere, in Garland, Texas,
02:14:24.639 where workers turn fur into felt.
02:14:29.269 Stetson says it's one ofthe few cowboy-hat makers
02:14:31.938 in the US that makeshat bodies from scratch.
02:14:35.650 This means it buys its own raw fur pelts
02:14:38.779 and processes them into felt,
02:14:40.864 compared to some other companies
02:14:42.282 that buy premade hat bodieswith the fur already blended.
02:14:48.246 Fur is the biggest indicator of quality
02:14:51.041 and therefore has thebiggest impact on price.
02:14:55.629 In the fur room,
02:14:56.755 Stetson stores fur fromPortugal, New Jersey,
02:14:59.508 Belgium, and Ukraine.
02:15:01.885 Paul Ray: This is someof our natural beaver.
02:15:07.641 Coarsest to the finer.
02:15:09.309 The finer beaver hats aremade out of natural beaver.
02:15:13.688 Very tight fur, very durable fur.
02:15:17.651 Good for all the weather, rain.
02:15:20.362 Nice feel.
02:15:22.989 Narrator: This kind of fur isn't cheap.
02:15:25.408 Just 1 pound of beaver fur can cost $125.
02:15:29.788 And chinchilla fur cancost four times the price.
02:15:33.416 Now consider that Stetson
02:15:34.835 only produces about twohats per pound of fur.
02:15:39.131 After the differentfurs are mixed together,
02:15:41.174 the blend goes through a blower,
02:15:42.759 which separates long hair from down.
02:15:46.179 Stetson uses down fur becauseit produces a stronger felt.
02:15:52.102 The machines in the factory are crucial,
02:15:54.312 but the job couldn't be donewithout trained workers.
02:15:57.691 The company employs more than200 workers at two factories
02:16:01.027 to guide the hats through each stage,
02:16:03.196 another element thatultimately impacts the price.
02:16:06.616 Justin Thomason: About100 sets of hands touch
02:16:07.951 every single one of ourhats as of right now.
02:16:11.079 Narrator: Workers pass the felt
02:16:12.080 through several stages of shrinking
02:16:14.082 until the proper hat size is reached.
02:16:17.294 Later, during the tipping stage,
02:16:19.129 a worker helps create the crown
02:16:20.964 by stretching and pulling the hat.
02:16:25.552 Then, as an employee turns the felt,
02:16:27.512 brass fingers of another machine
02:16:29.264 push the bottom out to form the brim.
02:16:33.268 One of the last stagesof producing the hat body
02:16:35.978 happens here, at the forming machine,
02:16:38.315 where the hat is submerged in hot water.
02:16:41.692 An employee pushes down the former,
02:16:43.904 and out comes the final hat body.
02:16:47.699 At the finishing factory,
02:16:48.992 machines taper and shapethe crown of the hat.
02:16:52.077 But the next few stagesrequire special attention.
02:16:56.833 Even as a machine sands thehat, an employee, again,
02:17:00.003 must be there to guide and feel it.
02:17:02.589 The worker will decide
02:17:03.632 when it has reached the proper thickness.
02:17:06.927 At other stations, craftspeopleuse scissors and pliers
02:17:09.971 to secure the buckle accent.
02:17:14.351 Others cut and sew on theleather strap by hand,
02:17:17.478 then the inner satin lining.
02:17:20.898 No hat makes it out of the factory
02:17:22.859 without a final quality inspection.
02:17:25.736 All hats go throughroughly the same process,
02:17:28.531 but premium ones have a few more features
02:17:30.784 that impact the final cost.
02:17:34.412 At $5,005, the Diamante Premier hat
02:17:37.624 is one of the most expensivecowboy hats you can buy.
02:17:41.460 It's made with two high-quality furs,
02:17:43.964 chinchilla and beaver.
02:17:46.674 There's also the addition ofthe 14-karat-gold buckle set,
02:17:50.219 which can add $1,000 to the cost of a hat.
02:17:54.182 Quality is only one reason
02:17:56.101 Stetson has the confidenceto make a hat like this
02:17:58.937 and be sure customers will buy it.
02:18:01.231 To understand the otherpiece of the puzzle,
02:18:03.400 you have to go back toStetson's beginning,
02:18:05.485 more than 150 years ago.
02:18:08.446 The founder, John Batterson Stetson,
02:18:10.781 is often credited with inventingthe modern-day cowboy hat
02:18:14.244 and setting the precedentfor what the style should be.
02:18:17.871 There are many replicas ofthe Burberry trench coat,
02:18:20.666 but they were the original,
02:18:23.003 and they set the industry standard
02:18:25.797 for that specific product.
02:18:27.215 And I think Stetson has alsodone a very similar thing,
02:18:30.552 where they have set aprecedent with the celebrities,
02:18:35.557 the politicians wearing the hat
02:18:38.309 and giving it that added value of,
02:18:40.520 yes, this is a luxury piece.
02:18:42.814 Narrator: In the late 1800s,sharpshooter Annie Oakley
02:18:45.816 became one of the firstfamous figures to don the hat.
02:18:49.029 In fact, in 2012, aStetson hat won by Oakley
02:18:52.531 sold at auction for just over $17,000.
02:18:56.870 While Stetson saw a dipin popularity in the '60s,
02:19:00.040 demand picked back up in the early '80s,
02:19:02.375 reignited by the release ofthe Indiana Jones movies.
02:19:06.087 The hat reached the headsof other famous figures,
02:19:08.380 like President RonaldReagan, around this time too.
02:19:11.760 But by the 21st century,
02:19:13.386 the kind of famous facewearing a Stetson had changed.
02:19:18.350 Dua Lipa's 2021 video for "Love Again"
02:19:21.019 opens on a shot of a floating Stetson,
02:19:23.313 then a shot of the singerlooking stylish and seductive
02:19:26.273 while wearing the hat.
02:19:27.901 And here are two more notable examples
02:19:30.070 that show how Stetson haslinked itself with high status.
02:19:33.823 There's Gigi Hadid holding a Stetson hat
02:19:36.159 in this Vogue shoot in 2018,
02:19:38.452 and three years later,Beyoncé wearing Stetson
02:19:41.206 on the cover of Harper'sBazaar in September 2021.
02:19:45.584 Both prove again how the brand has evolved
02:19:47.754 to something worthy of being worn
02:19:49.422 by the world's biggest names.
02:19:51.925 If you idolize those musicians,
02:19:54.886 you're going to want to wearthe brands that they wear.
02:20:00.266 Narrator: The most distinct aspect
02:20:01.893 of a Japanese bow is the length.
02:20:04.896 At over 2 meters tall, thesebows are difficult to handle.
02:20:09.150 And making them is just as challenging.
02:20:13.905 Bowmakers file raw bamboo
02:20:15.907 and insert over 100wedges to curve the bow.
02:20:21.162 Depending on the materials,these bows can cost over $2,000.
02:20:26.626 So how are these bows made?
02:20:28.878 And why are they so expensive?
02:20:32.549 Longbows have been usedin Japan for centuries,
02:20:35.885 but today you'll mostly find them
02:20:37.762 in a martial art called kyudo.
02:20:59.159 Narrator: You can buy a synthetic bow
02:21:00.618 for around $400.
02:21:02.871 But many experienced archers
02:21:04.622 prefer the feel of handmade bamboo bows.
02:21:08.585 Kanjuro Shibata's familyhas been making bows
02:21:11.087 for over 450 years.
02:21:13.756 It all starts with raw bamboo.
02:21:16.718 Kanjuro tries to obtainmost of his bamboo locally,
02:21:19.846 from around Kyoto.
02:21:21.639 But it has to dry for three years
02:21:23.641 before it's ready to be used.
02:21:26.519 Kanjuro shaves the dried bamboo
02:21:28.396 down to a thickness of 4 to 5 millimeters.
02:21:32.567 This is one of the mostphysically demanding parts
02:21:34.736 of the process, because thebamboo is dense and fibrous.
02:21:49.417 Narrator: A Japanese bowconsists of three main layers:
02:21:52.754 two pieces of bamboo and aninner core called nakauchi.
02:21:57.091 The nakauchi is madeout of laminated bamboo
02:21:59.719 and wax-tree wood,
02:22:01.095 and it's much harder thanthe bamboo on the outside.
02:22:28.831 Narrator: Kanjuro glues filed bamboo
02:22:30.583 on either side of thenakauchi to form the bow.
02:22:34.170 For some bows, he uses anatural glue called nibe,
02:22:37.465 which is harder to work with,
02:22:39.008 making the final product more expensive
02:22:41.010 than the bows that use synthetic glue.
02:22:43.805 But the hardest part isbending this straight bamboo
02:22:46.808 into the shape of a bow.
02:22:50.853 Kanjuro winds rope around the bamboo
02:22:53.189 and inserts over 100 wedges
02:22:55.275 while bending curves into the bow.
02:22:59.070 Because of the bow's length,
02:23:00.405 this process is extremely tedious.
02:23:03.700 But it must be done quickly,before the glue dries.
02:23:08.788 Thanks to decades of practice,
02:23:10.665 it takes Kanjuro around 10 to 15 minutes.
02:23:30.101 Narrator: Despite theimportance of the step,
02:23:31.811 Kanjuro only shapes his bows by eye.
02:24:13.269 Narrator: After the glue dries,Kanjuro removes the wedges
02:24:15.855 and bends the bow into its final shape.
02:24:42.882 Narrator: Kanjuro's bowscost anywhere from $900
02:24:45.426 to around $2,200, dependingon the materials used.
02:24:49.472 But bows made for displaycan cost a lot more.
02:25:07.031 Narrator: His family's clients include
02:25:08.574 everyone from local kyudo practitioners
02:25:11.202 to the imperial family.
02:25:13.204 But Kanjuro wants his bows
02:25:14.580 to be accessible to more people.
02:25:16.916 As long as it doesn'taffect the final quality,
02:25:19.252 he tries to make the processas efficient as he can.
02:26:11.804 Narrator: Despite the high price,
02:26:13.181 using a well-made bow that feels good
02:26:15.683 is essential for archers.
02:26:58.768 Narrator: If you look closely,you'll see these farmers
02:27:01.437 are scraping more thanjust the bark of this tree.
02:27:06.234 They're actually harvesting small,
02:27:07.985 clear droplets of mastic tree resin.
02:27:12.323 Those tiny drops are one ofGreece's most valuable products.
02:27:16.285 Just 1 kilogram can retail for about $350.
02:27:21.582 But for a tree like thisto produce any resin,
02:27:24.919 farmers must first harm it.
02:27:28.256 They do so by making as many as 600 cuts
02:27:31.133 into the bark, depending on the tree.
02:27:34.345 So, what exactly is mastic resin used for?
02:27:37.431 And why is it so expensive?
02:27:45.982 Mastic, or mastiha, asit's most commonly called,
02:27:49.402 has been produced in Chios,Greece, for centuries.
02:27:53.364 It has a unique flavor and aroma,
02:27:55.366 which has been describedas a little bitter,
02:27:57.285 sweet, fruity, and earthy.
02:28:00.079 Though it's not a household name,
02:28:01.789 mastiha goes into a variety of products
02:28:03.833 you might interact with every day.
02:28:06.544 It's found in things likecosmetics and desserts,
02:28:09.672 and on its own, the textureis chewy, hard, and gumlike,
02:28:13.551 which is why mastiha has been produced
02:28:15.469 as a natural chewing gum for years.
02:28:19.432 Producing this resin requires
02:28:20.975 continuous work throughout the year.
02:28:23.311 But the most criticalstage starts in July,
02:28:25.980 when farmers must first hurt the trees.
02:28:31.360 This is the point where farmersgo one by one to each tree
02:28:34.572 every week for about two months,
02:28:36.699 making incisions into the branches.
02:28:40.036 Many cuts like thiswould permanently damage
02:28:42.413 or kill other kinds oftrees, but not this kind.
02:28:58.304 Narrator: Alexis makes anywherefrom 20 to 600 incisions,
02:29:02.308 depending on the age of a treeand the number of branches.
02:29:05.978 It's important that farmers don't cut
02:29:07.605 too deeply into the tree.
02:29:09.774 If they do, they coulddamage the tree's core.
02:29:12.818 The trees can also healfrom these deeper cuts,
02:29:15.237 but it will take them threetimes longer to do so.
02:29:18.074 And if the farmers make toomany deep cuts into a tree,
02:29:20.910 there's a risk the tree will die.
02:29:23.454 And although bigger, oldertrees require more work,
02:29:26.624 they'll ultimately yield more resin.
02:29:48.854 Narrator: Even when atree reaches its peak,
02:29:50.773 it typically produces only about
02:29:52.858 200 grams of resin per year.
02:29:55.945 In September and October,
02:29:57.571 farmers complete themost physically demanding
02:29:59.782 part of the process,collecting the resin droplets.
02:30:06.080 They use tools called kamotiri
02:30:08.124 to scrape the secretedresin from the bark.
02:30:11.293 If this work isn't done right,
02:30:12.962 harvesters risk breaking the resin
02:30:14.755 into small pieces and losing money.
02:30:30.146 Narrator: Mastiha trees flourish here
02:30:32.064 because of the distinctclimate of Chios Island,
02:30:34.859 where there is little rain in the summer.
02:30:37.194 This makes it easier forfarmers to collect the resin.
02:30:40.990 In fact, people havetried, unsuccessfully,
02:30:43.451 to plant mastiha-producingtrees in places like Italy.
02:31:06.140 Narrator: Producers collect each droplet
02:31:07.600 from the ground and sieve it
02:31:08.893 to separate the clear drops from the soil.
02:31:12.730 The resin at this point
02:31:14.148 is a semitransparent and sticky liquid.
02:31:18.903 Farmers store the resinuntil the weather cools down,
02:31:21.363 so it will harden, becoming less sticky
02:31:23.491 and easier to handle.
02:31:25.743 After this, they wash the drops
02:31:27.745 before workers remove anyremaining dirt or impurities
02:31:31.457 and divide the drops according to size.
02:31:35.086 Cleaning the resin lasts several months,
02:31:37.046 and it requires patience and a good eye.
02:31:41.467 The women who participatein this work are crucial,
02:31:44.386 as it plays a huge part
02:31:45.679 in determining the resin's final value.
02:31:55.439 Narrator: From here, the resingoes to a processing facility
02:31:58.192 run by Chios Gum MasticGrowers Association.
02:32:01.779 This is where it will bepackaged as raw mastiha
02:32:04.240 or further processed intogum, supplements, and oils.
02:32:08.661 A pack of raw mastic resin like this
02:32:10.871 retails for about $3 for just 10 grams.
02:32:14.416 Exported resin can retail for a bit more,
02:32:17.086 at $35 for 100 grams.
02:32:40.359 Narrator: Another reason theresin remains so valuable
02:32:42.987 has to do with itspresumed health benefits.
02:32:46.073 In 2015, the European Medicines Agency
02:32:48.993 recognized mastiha as a formof traditional medication
02:32:52.454 for treating stomachissues and skin wounds.
02:32:55.499 But the varied uses of thisresin and its incredible value
02:32:59.044 make it vulnerable to imitation.
02:33:01.589 As a way of preventingthis, the European Union
02:33:03.883 has recognized mastiha produced in Chios
02:33:06.510 as a protected-designation-of-originproduct.
02:33:10.598 The production of the real mastiha
02:33:12.391 faces a threat from theclimate crisis, too.
02:33:16.478 In 2012, fires ravaged Chios,
02:33:18.856 and almost 30% of mastihatrees were destroyed.
02:33:22.902 Then, in 2016, another firedestroyed almost 90% of trees,
02:33:27.364 making an already difficult production
02:33:29.533 all the more challenging.
02:33:57.228 Narrator: But despite this damage,
02:33:58.729 demand for mastiha continues to grow.
02:34:01.398 And, naturally, this is goodfor farmers with lots of trees.
02:34:07.279 Alexis sells 1 kilogram for about $99.
02:34:11.075 This is the cost before the jump in price
02:34:13.202 when the resin is sold at retail.
02:34:15.663 He produces about 1,000kilograms of resin each season.
02:34:19.375 Even with the cost to maintain the trees,
02:34:21.502 this work provides him a good living.
02:34:23.796 And beyond good returns,
02:34:25.297 the work these farmers are doing
02:34:26.757 continues to preserve acenturies-old tradition
02:34:29.635 only found in Chios.
02:34:33.097 Narrator: Every year, GiheiFujiwara goes into the mountains
02:34:35.683 hunting for this: a matsutake mushroom.
02:34:40.187 If the harvest is low,
02:34:41.772 wholesale matsutake cancost over $500 per kilogram.
02:34:46.360 And over the past 70 years,
02:34:48.279 Japan's harvest has declined by over 95%.
02:34:52.283 Now the mushroom's future is unclear.
02:34:55.661 So, what makes thesemushrooms so expensive?
02:34:58.622 And why have they almost disappeared?
02:35:02.543 Matsutake can't exist without trees.
02:35:05.713 They grow connected to theroots of red pine trees
02:35:08.465 in a symbiotic relationship.
02:35:10.968 Matsutake grow in several countries,
02:35:13.053 including China and South Korea.
02:35:15.389 But Japan's fetch the highest price.
02:35:18.100 In 2021, the season's first matsutake
02:35:20.769 were auctioned off for over $7,000.
02:35:24.606 They're harvested once a year,
02:35:26.233 from around September to November.
02:35:28.819 But because the domesticharvest in Japan has plummeted,
02:35:31.989 the price is volatile.
02:35:34.408 Unlike other prized foods,
02:35:36.201 it's not a problem of overharvesting.
02:35:38.787 It's a problem of changing habitat.
02:35:42.416 Matsutake can't be grown on farms;
02:35:44.501 they have to be foraged by hand.
02:35:47.087 But foraging is no easy task.
02:35:50.591 Gihei Fujiwara has been foraging matsutake
02:35:52.968 for over 60 years.
02:35:56.096 There's a lot of anticipation
02:35:57.556 leading up to each harvest season.
02:36:21.080 Narrator: Gihei foragesfrom dawn till dusk,
02:36:23.624 returning home around middayto empty out his baskets.
02:36:27.544 Even for someone with his experience,
02:36:29.588 it can be hard to predictthe quality of a harvest.
02:36:49.525 Narrator: Even with a good harvest,
02:36:50.901 these mushrooms are difficult to find.
02:36:54.780 They blend in with the forest floor
02:36:56.407 and often don't growat the base of a tree.
02:37:00.160 Knowing where to lookis a result of decades
02:37:02.579 of foraging on this mountain.
02:37:46.123 Narrator: It's exhausting work,
02:37:48.417 but today, Gihei is rewarded,
02:37:50.294 filling several baskets each trip.
02:37:53.380 But his work isn't overwhen the harvest ends.
02:37:56.633 In the off season, Giheigoes back to the mountain
02:37:59.011 and tries to cultivate matsutake.
02:38:20.157 Narrator: Gihei alsotries to spread the spores
02:38:21.950 of matsutake to help them grow.
02:38:24.244 But cultivating matsutake thisway takes around five years,
02:38:27.915 and success isn't guaranteed.
02:38:30.959 Even though this year was a big harvest,
02:38:33.212 the long-term trend is in decline.
02:38:36.381 In 1953, Japan harvested around
02:38:39.176 6,400 metric tons of matsutake.
02:38:42.513 But in 2019, it harvestedonly 14 metric tons.
02:38:47.768 One of the biggestreasons for this decline
02:38:49.770 is a change in how forests are maintained.
02:39:25.013 Narrator: Matsutake alsogrows best with red pine trees
02:39:27.724 that are a few decades old.
02:39:29.851 But over the past century,
02:39:31.270 an invasive pest called pinewood nematode
02:39:33.855 has been hurting thegrowth of red pine trees
02:39:36.024 throughout Japan.
02:39:37.776 Without the trees, matsutakewon't be able to survive.
02:39:41.655 The mushrooms also need ample rainfall
02:39:44.116 and cool temperatures early in the season.
02:39:47.244 All of these factors create
02:39:48.579 a delicate balance for matsutake.
02:39:51.498 Harvests vary widely each year,
02:39:53.375 which causes big changes in price.
02:39:56.503 In 2018, prices were 20% to 50% lower
02:39:59.631 than the year beforebecause of a good harvest.
02:40:02.551 But in 2019, when there wasa period of dry weather,
02:40:05.971 prices almost doubled,reaching over $800 per kilogram
02:40:09.933 in some parts of Japan.
02:40:27.242 Narrator: Today, Japan importsover 90% of its matsutake
02:40:30.871 from places like China and South Korea.
02:40:34.041 In 2019, only around 14 ofthe 1,000 metric tons consumed
02:40:38.920 were harvested domestically.
02:40:41.173 Imported matsutake are more affordable
02:40:43.216 compared to the ones grown in Japan.
02:40:45.761 But some people consider these mushrooms
02:40:47.512 to be less fresh and not as flavorful.
02:40:50.974 Matsutake with a closedcap are often considered
02:40:53.810 to be the most valuable.
02:40:55.437 But different sizes are usedin different types of dishes.
02:41:14.706 Narrator: A full-course meal at this inn
02:41:16.500 costs around $130.
02:41:50.200 Narrator: Due to the declining harvests,
02:41:52.035 matsutake mushrooms werelisted as "vulnerable" in 2020.
02:41:56.623 But the species isn't gone yet.
02:42:13.557 Narrator: But if its growth
02:42:14.433 and environment aren't sustained,
02:42:16.435 this legendary mushroom
02:42:17.728 likely won't get cheaper anytime soon.
02:42:28.238 Narrator: Zisha teapotsare made by artisans
02:42:30.365 like Boqin Tang. She hadto study for 25 years
02:42:33.744 to be considered a senior teapot maker,
02:42:36.329 which lets her sell a teapot like this
02:42:38.457 for $20,000 to $30,000.
02:42:54.681 Narrator: But before Tangever touches the clay,
02:42:57.517 the process starts witha unique raw material
02:43:00.187 that's disappearing.
02:43:04.065 So, what does it taketo make a zisha teapot?
02:43:06.818 And why are they so expensive?
02:43:12.449 Zisha teapots were one ofthe first teapots ever made,
02:43:15.577 dating back to 10th-century China.
02:43:18.455 They're named after the rare clay
02:43:19.998 that is made from350-million-year-old zisha ore.
02:43:24.461 The ore can only be found in Dingshuzhen,
02:43:26.963 primarily in Huanglong Mountain.
02:43:29.049 It's near the city of Yixing,
02:43:30.801 which is known asChina's ceramics capital.
02:43:34.054 Zisha teapot experts havebeen using the same process
02:43:36.723 for over 600 years.
02:43:41.144 The ore is powdered, then folded
02:43:42.979 and worked in a way tocreate small pockets
02:43:45.357 that promote airflow in two directions
02:43:47.692 throughout the pot.
02:43:50.028 This is known as dual porosity,
02:43:52.155 and zisha teapot makers and customers say
02:43:54.491 this oxygen flow canintensify the flavor of tea,
02:43:57.994 just like with a finely aerated wine.
02:44:00.664 It's one of a few ofzisha's special properties
02:44:03.333 believed to enhance the taste of the tea.
02:44:07.003 Scientific analysis shows that
02:44:08.672 the mineral composition of zisha
02:44:10.632 allows the temperatures to fluctuate less
02:44:12.592 when these pots are put to heat.
02:44:14.469 Fewer fluctuations meansthe flavor of the tea
02:44:16.930 is more likely to be preserved.
02:44:22.644 Making zisha teapots isa painstaking process.
02:44:28.400 Each step is done by hand.
02:44:38.201 Narrator: Artists firstsmash the prepared zisha clay
02:44:40.662 into very thin layerswith a wooden mallet.
02:44:43.915 It can take a year to learnhow to do this correctly.
02:44:48.086 For a round teapot,
02:44:49.170 the largest slice is formed into a tube
02:44:51.339 on a revolving round plate.
02:44:57.262 Boqin will then "pat the body"using a thin wooden tool,
02:45:00.181 beating the clay into the desired shape.
02:45:03.560 For more intricate teapots,
02:45:04.936 makers scratch patternsonto the hardened clay
02:45:07.272 and attach extra decor,
02:45:09.274 all of which can increase the final value.
02:45:13.194 Zisha teapots are typically small
02:45:15.113 and hold just a cup of water,
02:45:16.865 so they don't require much clay.
02:45:18.909 But getting that little bit of clay
02:45:20.660 isn't simple or affordable.
02:45:23.914 The limited supply of zisha ore
02:45:25.790 boosts the cost of the raw material.
02:45:29.127 To protect the resource,
02:45:30.378 China's government hasbanned mining in Huanglong.
02:45:46.728 Narrator: Boqin uses clayher family has reserved
02:45:48.688 since the '90s.
02:45:50.523 That's also the decade she officially
02:45:52.317 began making these teapots.
02:45:54.569 To achieve her senior title,
02:45:56.446 Boqin needed 25 years of experience,
02:45:58.823 at least five goldawards for her creations,
02:46:01.493 and to pass a rigorous test.
02:46:28.103 Narrator: The next levelfor Boqin to achieve,
02:46:29.896 which is also the highest,
02:46:31.314 is the title of master craftsman.
02:46:33.692 This requires at least 30years of experience. Why?
02:46:37.821 Because customers aren't paying
02:46:39.114 for just the finite raw material,
02:46:41.199 but also for a high level of artistry.
02:47:09.352 Narrator: For tea enthusiasts,
02:47:10.687 buying a senior or master's zisha teapot
02:47:12.897 is like buying functional art.
02:47:15.358 Functional in that it's made
02:47:16.776 for a great tea-drinking experience,
02:47:19.320 and like art because drinkers appreciate
02:47:21.448 the delicate work andskill required to make it.
02:48:05.366 Narrator: A telltale sign of just how well
02:48:07.035 a teapot is crafted
02:48:08.536 is how liquid pours from the neck.
02:48:10.705 The tea should pour out splatter-free
02:48:12.749 from a well-made zisha teapot.
02:48:16.086 In the end, it's the importance
02:48:17.879 tea making and tea drinking have in China
02:48:20.632 that makes such expensive teapots
02:48:22.509 worth what customers pay.
02:48:36.815 Narrator: Hong Daesik hasstumbled upon something
02:48:38.900 truly rare.
02:48:43.071 Narrator: It's a ginseng root
02:48:44.197 that grew naturally in the wild,
02:48:46.157 and it will sell for tensof thousands of dollars.
02:48:54.916 Narrator: But mostother classes of ginseng
02:48:56.668 won't sell for anywhere near this much.
02:48:59.420 So what makes this root so special?
02:49:01.965 And why is wild ginseng so expensive?
02:49:08.555 Ginseng is one of the mostpopular herbs in the world,
02:49:11.683 but there's a wide rangefor what it'll cost you.
02:49:14.394 On average, a single ginseng root
02:49:16.437 found growing naturallyin the wild in South Korea
02:49:19.607 can cost thousands ofdollars, depending on its age.
02:49:23.236 Farmed ginseng, on the other hand,
02:49:25.155 could only cost about $25for 10 roots in South Korea.
02:49:29.784 The third category is in the middle.
02:49:32.036 It's called wild-simulated ginseng,
02:49:34.289 and it can cost hundredsto thousands of dollars.
02:49:37.792 For 28 years, Hong Daesik has been growing
02:49:40.378 and harvesting wild-simulated ginseng
02:49:42.630 in the mountains aroundSuncheon, South Korea.
02:49:45.508 Wild ginseng used to grow here naturally,
02:49:48.052 but demand for the herbhas led to overharvesting,
02:49:50.597 making it incredibly rare to find today.
02:49:53.224 Which is why harvestershave moved to growing
02:49:55.018 the similar-looking but less expensive
02:49:57.353 wild-simulated variety.
02:49:59.772 In order to harvestwild-simulated ginseng,
02:50:02.233 Daesik has to plant seeds.
02:50:04.652 But growing this type of ginseng
02:50:06.321 may not be worth the hassle.
02:50:08.198 In fact, 90% of the wild-simulated plants
02:50:11.117 Daesik grows won't survive.
02:50:21.044 Narrator: This is partly due
02:50:22.003 to the plant's need for ample shade
02:50:24.047 and its sensitivity to high temperatures,
02:50:26.257 overhumidity, and disease.
02:50:28.635 When grown in forests,
02:50:29.886 ginseng is also vulnerableto hungry animals.
02:50:49.781 Narrator: After eightyears, Daesik can begin
02:50:52.200 harvesting the ginseng he's planted.
02:50:54.786 Harvesting these roots requiresspecial attention and care.
02:50:58.331 Daesik must dig around the root,
02:50:59.832 being careful not todamage any part of it.
02:51:29.821 Narrator: Roots that grow in forests
02:51:31.281 are often much smaller, knobbier,
02:51:33.491 and have more growth scars.
02:51:35.451 Similar to trees, growth scars on ginseng
02:51:38.037 can be used to determine its age.
02:51:40.415 And the more scars, the higher the price.
02:52:10.820 Narrator: But the most expensive ones
02:52:12.322 are both old and foundnaturally in the wild.
02:52:38.097 Narrator: So, why are older and wilder
02:52:39.807 ginseng roots so valuable, anyway?
02:52:42.602 Older roots are believed to have
02:52:44.062 higher concentrations of ginsenosides,
02:52:46.773 the all-star bioactiveingredient of ginseng
02:52:49.484 that many believe givesit medicinal benefits.
02:52:52.153 Higher concentrations of these compounds
02:52:54.072 are believed to make the root more potent.
02:52:56.491 But not all of ginseng's benefits
02:52:58.284 have been scientifically verified.
02:53:00.703 While some studies suggestginseng has medicinal benefits,
02:53:04.040 like reducing pain and improving learning,
02:53:06.751 other studies debate its effects.
02:53:08.961 This study suggests "ginsengis no more effective
02:53:11.839 than a placebo in enhancingphysical performance."
02:53:15.426 And this larger study suggests that
02:53:17.178 "the clinical efficacy of ginseng
02:53:19.097 remains to be established."
02:53:21.432 Once harvested, ginseng spoilsquickly at room temperature.
02:53:24.936 So fresh roots are typicallyconsumed immediately,
02:53:27.605 brewed in tea, or preserved in liquors.
02:53:32.902 Because of its short shelf life,
02:53:34.487 a majority of the ginsengproducts you'll find in stores
02:53:37.281 are sold in liquid,dried, or powdered forms.
02:53:40.660 Since 2011, wild-simulatedginseng has been listed
02:53:43.788 as a "special forestproduct" in South Korea,
02:53:46.874 with everything fromcultivation to distribution
02:53:49.377 controlled by the Korean government.
02:53:52.046 And like other labeling certifications,
02:53:54.465 wild-simulated products in Korea
02:53:56.551 need to pass inspections to guarantee
02:53:58.886 their quality and authenticity.
02:54:01.722 This helps ensure the product
02:54:02.849 is high quality and sustainable,
02:54:04.559 while giving ginsengharvesters, like Daesik,
02:54:06.644 the opportunity to profit from the crop.
02:54:09.856 And as demand for alternative medicines
02:54:11.941 and healthy foods increases,the pressure to supply
02:54:14.902 wild and simulated ginsengwill also likely grow.
02:54:18.823 Which is why creating asustainable market for ginseng
02:54:21.534 is more important than ever.
02:54:26.330 Narrator: In Kalymnos, Greece,
02:54:27.748 divers have long profited from one of
02:54:29.584 the ocean's naturaltreasures: sea sponges.
02:54:34.005 You can pick up a synthetic sponge
02:54:35.715 for just a couple of dollars.
02:54:37.550 But a single sea sponge
02:54:38.968 hand-harvested from theMediterranean Sea floor
02:54:41.721 could set you back $30.
02:54:44.640 Harvesting these spongesis dangerous work,
02:54:47.185 and the risks don't guarantee big rewards.
02:54:50.855 Sponges used to be plentifulin the Mediterranean,
02:54:53.232 but these days they're hard to find.
02:54:55.693 And it's making this alreadydifficult job harder.
02:54:59.447 So what's happening to the sponges here?
02:55:01.782 And is this what'smaking them so expensive?
02:55:06.162 Synthetic sponges, likethe ones commonly used
02:55:08.831 to wash dishes, are cheap.
02:55:11.042 And that makes them popular.
02:55:12.877 But natural sea sponges havebeen used for centuries.
02:55:16.756 And they're still essentialfor pottery, painting,
02:55:19.592 and even as a surgical tool.
02:55:21.928 But to get your handson a sponge like this,
02:55:24.388 a diver first had to hand-harvestit from the seafloor.
02:55:28.893 High-quality commercial sea sponges
02:55:30.728 are found in select regions,
02:55:32.730 including off the coast ofFlorida and the Caribbean Sea.
02:55:36.275 The most valuable onesare largely found here,
02:55:39.111 in the Mediterranean.
02:55:41.155 But they're not so easy to come by.
02:55:43.115 And it means the dangerouseffort to find them
02:55:45.368 isn't always worthwhile.
02:55:48.287 One of the most dangerousparts of harvesting sponges
02:55:50.998 happens at the end of a dive.
02:55:53.668 Although it's less common now,
02:55:55.336 the most common injury divers face
02:55:57.338 is decompression sickness.
02:55:59.423 This happens when divers transfer
02:56:01.133 from a high-pressure environment
02:56:02.718 to a low-pressure environment too quickly.
02:56:05.846 Nitrogen builds up in a diver's body
02:56:07.890 as they go deeper underwater,
02:56:09.767 and the body needs timeto release this nitrogen
02:56:12.270 before reaching the surface.
02:56:14.146 Otherwise, divers riskhurting parts of their body,
02:56:17.275 or worse.
02:56:38.671 Narrator: Not only is thisone of the biggest risks,
02:56:40.798 but it's also more time-consumingthan the dive itself.
02:56:44.302 The time it takes to resurface
02:56:46.012 depends on how deep a diver swims.
02:56:48.639 A diver might only spend 30minutes diving at 50 meters,
02:56:52.560 but they could spendbetween one and two hours
02:56:55.146 just returning to the surface safely.
02:57:15.333 Narrator: It's becoming crucial for divers
02:57:16.876 to fish in deeper waters,
02:57:18.586 where more valuable spongespecies can be easier to find.
02:57:22.298 But diving deeper also means
02:57:23.924 a diver has limited time to harvest.
02:57:27.136 Otherwise, too much timeis lost to resurfacing
02:57:29.805 and resting between dives.
02:57:32.266 Despite the little time they have,
02:57:33.976 extracting the sponges isn'ta quick or simple task.
02:57:37.938 At times, divers mustgrab hold of a sponge
02:57:40.274 with both hands, using their force
02:57:42.693 and a bit of wiggling sideto side to extract one.
02:57:47.156 It's important that theyleave enough sponge substrate
02:57:49.575 attached to the seabed.
02:57:51.160 That way, the sponge hasthe potential to regrow
02:57:53.996 and the population can be sustained.
02:57:57.249 Another hurdle divers face
02:57:59.001 is how many sponges they can harvest.
02:58:02.463 In shallow waters, divers can harvest
02:58:04.590 only as many sponges as they can carry.
02:58:07.927 Typically, a diver will carry
02:58:09.428 about three to fournets' worth of sponges,
02:58:11.931 or about 8 kilograms, to the surface
02:58:14.558 before going back down to search for more.
02:58:17.561 But there's no guarantee a diver
02:58:19.021 will find that many sponges.
02:58:21.774 Today especially, there's agood chance they'll return
02:58:24.777 with fewer sponges than they hoped for.
02:58:39.458 Narrator: There are likely a few factors
02:58:41.252 causing this decline.
02:58:51.429 Narrator: AntonisKampourakis spent 50 years
02:58:53.889 diving for sponges.
02:58:55.641 He believes the climate crisis
02:58:57.226 is one major cause ofthe declining population.
02:59:00.479 The other main issues arelikely waste and disease.
02:59:25.129 Narrator: Sponges used to beknown as "soft gold" in Greece.
02:59:28.215 They thrived in these warm waters,
02:59:29.967 which is why the Greek islands,and especially Kalymnos,
02:59:32.970 have historically been acenter for sponge fishing.
02:59:36.223 But the dangerous nature of this work
02:59:38.017 and the lack of sponges in the sea
02:59:40.019 make it difficult to finddivers who want to do the job.
02:59:44.023 Compared to the hundreds in the '60s,
02:59:46.358 only about 30 to 40 people
02:59:48.068 still dive for sponges in Kalymnos today.
02:59:52.072 And this is actually one of the reasons
02:59:53.866 the prices of some spongeshave gotten so high.
02:59:57.328 Because fewer people divefor the sponges here,
03:00:00.080 and because the ones that areleft are difficult to find,
03:00:02.833 the sponges have more time to grow.
03:00:05.544 And this means the ones diversdo find are often bigger,
03:00:09.048 which makes them more valuable.
03:00:12.593 At a separate processing facility,
03:00:14.762 producers clean batchesof the extracted sponges
03:00:17.431 to remove any remainingblack residue from the sea.
03:00:21.644 A worker then trimseach sponge one by one.
03:00:25.272 Although bigger sponges are worth more,
03:00:27.525 workers often cut them down.
03:00:29.902 This makes a sponge easierto clean and bathe with
03:00:32.905 and naturally more marketable.
03:00:35.491 Nikolas Makriplis processesfive sponge species
03:00:38.577 from the Mediterranean.
03:00:40.246 Sponges from this region are desirable
03:00:42.414 for their durability and softness.
03:01:19.869 Narrator: Fino is one of themost coveted types he sells.
03:01:23.122 A single 12-centimetersponge of this species
03:01:26.125 can retail for $30.
03:01:58.699 Narrator: Higher pricesmean a better return
03:02:00.701 for divers and merchants like Nikolas.
03:02:03.537 But with fewer sponges tofind, the future of an industry
03:02:06.749 that once carried the island of Kalymnos
03:02:09.001 has a major hurdle to face.
03:02:41.867 Narrator: Meet the elusive vicuña,
03:02:44.703 whose wool is worth more than gold.
03:02:49.875 Here in northern Bolivia,
03:02:51.418 a single kilogram of thiswool can sell for $370.
03:02:56.340 And once the producthits shelves in Italy,
03:02:58.801 a coat made of vicuña woolcan cost around $35,000.
03:03:03.597 But herding communities inthe Apolobamba mountain range
03:03:06.475 can only shear vicuñasonce every two years.
03:03:10.646 And while conservationefforts have ensured
03:03:12.606 that vicuñas thrive intheir natural habitat,
03:03:15.234 this can mean danger for communities
03:03:16.902 rounding up the wild herd.
03:03:21.824 So how are conservationists
03:03:23.409 and local communities working together?
03:03:25.786 And why is the wool theyproduce so expensive?
03:03:32.501 Vicuña wool is extremelyfine compared to other furs.
03:03:36.296 Vicuña wool density ismeasured in microns.
03:03:38.924 An adult vicuña produces woolthat measures 13 microns.
03:03:42.761 Compare that to alpacawool, at 22 to 24 microns,
03:03:46.306 or llama, at around 30 microns.
03:03:49.059 This ultrafine fur iswhat makes vicuña wool
03:03:51.603 the most expensive textile in the world.
03:03:54.481 But to produce fine wool like this,
03:03:56.650 the first step is capturing the herd.
03:04:03.574 The herding day begins witha traditional ceremony.
03:04:09.955 And then, in comes the fleet.
03:04:33.520 Narrator: The community beganpreparing for this capture
03:04:35.647 a month in advance.
03:04:37.316 In addition to monitoring the herd
03:04:38.817 and tracking its movement,
03:04:40.152 they must build what'scalled a capture chute.
03:04:44.281 This acts as a herding device
03:04:45.991 to move the vicuña towarda temporary enclosure.
03:05:23.320 Narrator: Once the vicuñasare properly grappled,
03:05:25.447 they can be sheared.
03:05:26.698 Their fur must be at least2 1/2 centimeters long
03:05:29.535 for collection.
03:05:31.120 This is a similarrequirement to alpaca fur,
03:05:33.497 but vicuñas produce a muchthinner and softer fiber.
03:05:42.089 In an effort to organize the herding
03:05:43.799 and conservation of the vicuña,
03:05:45.884 a management board was created.
03:05:48.971 Richard Ponciano serves asthe authority of his province.
03:06:06.238 Narrator: Embracing the herdof vicuñas is important,
03:06:08.782 because raising camelids, like alpacas,
03:06:11.160 is an essential way oflife here in Bolivia.
03:06:29.595 Narrator: Unlike alpacas,vicuñas cannot be domesticated,
03:06:32.848 and they are much moredifficult to come by.
03:06:35.142 But the good news isthat the herd is growing.
03:06:38.270 As of 2019, the vicuña countin Apolobamba was over 12,000,
03:06:42.983 and it is estimated to havegrown another 9% since then.
03:06:46.612 This is an astonishing number
03:06:48.655 given that at one point
03:06:49.781 there were only about 65vicuñas left in this region.
03:06:53.744 The vicuñas in the Apolobamba
03:06:55.412 Integrated Management Natural Area,
03:06:57.623 or AMNI, are now protected,
03:07:00.626 and the years in between shearing
03:07:02.127 are entirely focused on conservation.
03:07:26.818 Narrator: That's Humber Alberto,
03:07:28.237 a technical manager overseeing18 different communities
03:07:31.531 in the areas that shear vicuñas.
03:07:38.121 Narrator: Managers likeHumber make sure that
03:07:39.957 communities are equipped to produce
03:07:41.750 the best possible product,
03:07:43.627 therefore getting the bestprice for their yield.
03:07:54.513 Humber and other technical managers
03:07:56.181 make sure the communities
03:07:57.307 are equipped withmechanical shearing tools.
03:08:01.103 Before 2019, shearing was done
03:08:03.105 with scissors and took much longer.
03:08:06.066 However, there are still communities
03:08:07.901 using scissors in the highlands,
03:08:09.736 where Humber and his team
03:08:10.862 can't carry their power generators.
03:08:14.366 No matter what, they always try to send
03:08:16.243 one trained shearer out to each community.
03:08:18.870 This helps ensure thehighest-quality product
03:08:21.373 and keeps vicuñas and shearers safe.
03:08:55.615 Narrator: After a checkup on their health,
03:08:57.367 the vicuñas are releasedback into the wild.
03:09:04.207 Bolivia offers three kinds of fiber,
03:09:06.418 mainly to European markets.
03:09:08.962 These are raw fiber, cleanedfiber, and pre-carding fiber.
03:09:12.883 Pre-carding fiberincreases the initial cost
03:09:14.968 of the product by 25%.
03:09:17.220 This is a process that involves
03:09:18.555 manually removingbristles from the fleece.
03:09:21.641 Pre-carding one to twofleeces takes a full day.
03:09:33.278 Narrator: Humber hopes to see more
03:09:34.738 industrialization ofthe vicuña-wool industry
03:09:37.366 in Bolivia in the future.
03:09:39.368 For now, this is the final stage
03:09:41.203 many residents ofApolobamba will ever see.
03:09:44.498 More than 90% of thisfiber is bound for Italy,
03:09:47.459 where it will be spun intodesigner textiles at Loro Piana.
03:10:06.853 Narrator: But nearbyartisans crafting garments
03:10:08.855 out of vicuña wool would like to see
03:10:10.649 more vicuña fiber stay local.
03:10:14.194 They purchase it at a national level
03:10:15.946 with an invoice from the state.
03:10:17.739 This gets shared amongat least 10 craftspeople,
03:10:20.117 who are only able to receive
03:10:21.576 2 or 3 kilograms per year.
03:10:48.728 Narrator: For Mery, producing a sweater
03:10:50.397 from vicuña fiber isthe same amount of labor
03:10:53.191 as producing an alpaca sweater.
03:10:55.777 But she can earn a lot morefrom selling vicuña products.
03:11:00.073 She says the state doesn't allow her
03:11:01.741 enough raw material tomake a significant profit
03:11:04.369 selling vicuña products.
03:11:06.288 To get enough material to meet demand,
03:11:08.457 some artisans turn to the black market.
03:11:26.975 Narrator: As for the vicuñagarments she sells locally ...
03:11:49.122 Narrator: That's a farcry from the $11,000
03:11:51.458 that it costs to purchase avicuña shawl from Loro Piana.
03:11:55.086 But the vicuña industry isstill growing in Bolivia,
03:11:58.131 as more communities develop the skills
03:12:00.050 and tools necessary to produce the fiber.
03:12:17.817 Narrator: It's 8 a.m. in Indonesia,
03:12:19.694 and Sarimanto is harvesting rattan
03:12:21.696 in the rainforests of Borneo.
03:12:25.075 Depending on the length and thickness,
03:12:26.993 just one pole of exportedrattan can cost $35.
03:12:31.665 That's over three times thecost of a similar bamboo pole.
03:12:35.794 And when it's woven into furniture,
03:12:37.546 a rattan chair can cost over $2,000.
03:12:41.591 But to get his hands on rattan,
03:12:43.385 Sarimanto often has to harvest it
03:12:45.136 in difficult and dangerous conditions.
03:12:48.557 So why is rattan so hard to harvest?
03:12:51.685 And is this what makes it so expensive?
03:12:56.940 Rattan is a climbing palm vine
03:12:58.692 that grows on rainforest trees.
03:13:00.902 It flourishes in the tropicalclimate of Indonesia,
03:13:03.905 which accounts for most ofthe world's rattan supply.
03:13:07.117 Often, rattan is incorrectlyreferred to as wicker,
03:13:10.453 which isn't a materialbut a style of weaving.
03:13:13.623 Other materials, likebamboo and sugarcane,
03:13:16.376 can also be made into wicker products.
03:13:19.212 Rattan, however, is coveted
03:13:21.131 because it can be bent andmanipulated more easily,
03:13:23.883 making it more versatilethan the alternatives.
03:13:26.928 But harvesting rattan is tiring and risky.
03:13:31.683 Just after dawn, Sarimantobegins his journey
03:13:34.227 to the rainforests of Borneo by boat,
03:13:37.439 carrying all he needs with him.
03:13:44.863 After an hour's boat ride,
03:13:46.239 Sarimanto arrives at his destination:
03:13:49.826 a plot in the rainforest
03:13:51.036 that his family has owned for decades.
03:13:56.875 Here, he has to figure out
03:13:58.293 which rattan vines areripe enough to harvest.
03:14:15.810 Narrator: The rattan that'sripe for harvesting now
03:14:17.604 was planted at leastseven or eight years ago.
03:14:20.899 If Sarimanto harvests too soon,
03:14:22.692 before the rattan turns green
03:14:24.277 and the outer bark detaches from it,
03:14:26.237 he'll cut into his own profits.
03:14:38.291 Narrator: When they'vefound the right vines,
03:14:39.834 harvesters use machetes tocut them out of their clumps.
03:14:43.421 But wild rattan has thorns,just like rose stems.
03:14:47.425 So they have to carefullynavigate the thorns,
03:14:49.719 for their own safety and forthe rattan to be sellable.
03:14:53.765 The thorns aren't the onlydangerous part of the job.
03:14:56.601 And neither is the boat ride,
03:14:58.019 even during the rainy season.
03:15:00.438 Wild animals areSarimanto's biggest threat.
03:15:25.755 Narrator: When he hasharvested as much rattan
03:15:27.173 as he can carry,
03:15:28.133 Sarimanto must make the trip back home
03:15:30.051 to prepare the rattan for sale.
03:15:52.699 Narrator: After he returns,
03:15:53.825 Sarimanto soaks the rattanfor least three days,
03:15:56.995 so the skin is easier topeel when it's processed.
03:16:02.250 Raw material is the basisof all rattan goods,
03:16:05.211 but it has to pass through many hands
03:16:07.088 before it can reach its full value.
03:16:09.507 Sarimanto sells his raw rattan
03:16:11.468 to producers like Rusniyati,
03:16:13.386 who send workers to pick upthe rattan and process it.
03:16:16.639 While Rusniyati can buy raw rattan
03:16:18.808 from harvesters like Sarimantoat an affordable rate,
03:16:21.936 she still has the cost ofpreparing the rattan for weaving.
03:16:25.565 That includes wages for workers
03:16:27.275 and electricity for machinery.
03:16:34.199 Narrator: Those 50 kilos will last her
03:16:35.867 about two to three months.
03:16:38.328 And the costs are evenhigher for larger producers,
03:16:41.331 who are often located furtherfrom the processing sites.
03:16:44.793 That typically requiresmore transportation
03:16:47.086 and higher expenses,especially during rainy season.
03:16:51.925 If there's flooding, it could take longer
03:16:53.510 to get from the harvestinglocation to the producers.
03:16:56.971 And these challenging work conditions
03:16:58.598 mean buyers may have topay the middlemen more.
03:17:02.143 Most importantly, it's crucialthat the rattan stay dry.
03:17:18.868 Narrator: Once middlemencollect the raw rattan,
03:17:20.578 they can begin processing it.
03:17:23.081 They treat thinner rattanby placing it in tarps
03:17:25.708 and smoking it with sulfur,
03:17:27.710 while thicker rattan is boiled in oil.
03:17:30.755 This process takes a day or two.
03:17:33.216 Then it's dried in the sunto remove all moisture.
03:17:36.386 That takes another two to three days.
03:17:39.472 Depending on the processing costs,
03:17:41.391 just preparing the rattan
03:17:42.976 can cost half of whatRusniyati sells in a month.
03:17:52.360 Narrator: Rusniyati sellssmall handmade rattan items,
03:17:55.446 such as plates and baskets.
03:17:57.907 She'll price each one at alittle over $10 to sell locally.
03:18:02.120 A similar basket soldinternationally by a larger retailer
03:18:05.456 can go for over $100.
03:18:08.418 And it's likely they'll sell,
03:18:09.961 because the demand forrattan goods is high.
03:18:14.299 Rattan is a multibillion-dollar industry,
03:18:16.718 and the rattan furniture market
03:18:18.094 is anticipated to grow 5% by 2027.
03:18:22.140 But this isn't the firsttime rattan has been popular.
03:18:25.643 Wicker made with rattan became popular
03:18:27.687 in Europe and the Americasduring the Victorian era.
03:18:31.316 The invention of synthetic wicker,
03:18:33.192 which can withstand tougher weather,
03:18:35.194 brought the material backinto style in the 1970s.
03:18:38.781 It made another comeback in the late 2010s
03:18:41.367 for its "boho" aesthetic.
03:18:44.329 But while demand for rattanfurniture is increasing,
03:18:47.206 raw-rattan harvesters areseeing smaller profits
03:18:49.834 than they have before.
03:19:15.109 Narrator: Sarimanto will sell the 70 kilos
03:19:17.153 of raw rattan he harvested for $10.
03:19:20.156 That's about 14 cents per kilo.
03:19:22.617 But in the 1980s, raw-rattan harvesters
03:19:25.119 were getting 5 timesas much for that amount.
03:19:28.665 Sarimanto attributesthis loss to a 2011 law
03:19:31.501 passed by the Indonesian government
03:19:33.378 banning the export of rawor semi-processed rattan
03:19:36.172 to foreign countries.
03:19:38.257 Leading up to the law,
03:19:39.592 Indonesia was dealing with deforestation
03:19:41.803 and overharvesting of rattan,
03:19:43.638 causing supply shortages.
03:19:45.932 The law aimed to preventexports of raw rattan
03:19:48.601 and benefit domestic producers.
03:19:50.812 It also helped limit how muchrattan could be harvested.
03:19:54.774 It was mainly large-scale producers
03:19:56.484 that benefited from this shift,
03:19:58.069 leaving harvesters like Sarimanto
03:19:59.821 struggling to make ends meet.
03:20:02.657 That's why Sarimantoand harvesters like him
03:20:05.451 want the government tochange the trade laws
03:20:07.620 and ease their burdens.
03:20:18.715 since we know that rattan priceabroad is quite expensive.
03:20:29.976 Narrator: Thousands of individual threads,
03:20:32.103 loaded by hand, arewoven together to create
03:20:34.981 one of the most intricatefabrics in the world:
03:20:38.401 Leavers lace.
03:20:40.528 But making this lace isn't easy.
03:20:43.281 A new design can takethree months to produce.
03:20:46.367 And depending on the materials,
03:20:48.036 1 square meter can cost over $500.
03:20:52.290 Despite the premium price,
03:20:53.958 the lace industry in France
03:20:55.501 is a fraction of its former size.
03:20:58.046 And it's hard to find new lacemakers to continue the trade.
03:21:02.175 So how is Leavers lace made?
03:21:04.635 And why is it so expensive?
03:21:10.266 This is a Leavers loom.
03:21:11.809 It's 6 meters long and over 100 years old.
03:21:15.855 These looms were invented
03:21:16.939 to match the quality of handmade lace.
03:21:19.984 Each design is translated frompaper into these punch cards,
03:21:24.322 which are fed into theloom to create a pattern.
03:21:27.867 These looms are essentialfor making Leavers lace,
03:21:30.745 but there are only afew hundred left today,
03:21:34.373 40 of which are at this factory
03:21:36.375 in the northern French city of Caudry.
03:21:39.420 Jean Bracq has beenmaking lace since 1889.
03:22:00.858 Narrator: Unlike cheapermass-produced lace,
03:22:03.027 designs aren't embroideredon top of fabric.
03:22:05.905 They're continuously woven,
03:22:07.490 creating a beautifully complex pattern.
03:22:10.868 The machine might do the weaving,
03:22:12.954 but it takes around 20 peopleto produce Leavers lace.
03:22:17.834 It all starts with a design.
03:22:20.795 Jean Bracq uses a library of old designs,
03:22:23.923 some from as far back as 1925.
03:22:27.468 But it also creates new designs,
03:22:29.387 which can take three tofive weeks to complete.
03:22:32.849 This is the most time-consumingpart of the process.
03:22:36.269 But the most delicateis threading the loom.
03:22:39.939 Thousands of individualthreads feed into the machine.
03:22:43.442 Detailed designs need morethreads, which raises the price.
03:22:47.864 Workers load these smalldisks, called bobbins, by hand,
03:22:51.367 keeping each thread separate and taut.
03:23:03.296 Narrator: Workers placeeach bobbin into a carriage
03:23:05.590 and check to ensureconsistent weight and tension.
03:23:23.941 Narrator: Once the loom starts running,
03:23:25.735 lace makers are surroundedby an ocean of sound.
03:23:38.039 Despite being such an old machine,
03:23:40.333 each loom runs with extreme precision.
03:23:45.296 The loom weaves a design line by line
03:23:47.798 as workers refill it with more thread.
03:23:51.135 Loom experts, called tullists,
03:23:53.429 are in charge of overseeingthe whole weaving process.
03:23:57.058 They watch each loom, lookingand listening for any tears.
03:24:01.437 A mistake at this step couldseriously set back production.
03:24:06.817 If there's a break, tullistsreach into the loom,
03:24:09.237 carefully repairing individual threads.
03:24:14.700 Frédéric has been workingon these looms for 26 years.
03:24:18.454 He checks to ensurethat the original design
03:24:20.831 is being recreated on the loom.
03:24:37.723 Narrator: Each step requires an expert,
03:24:40.184 but this makes findingnew workers challenging.
03:25:41.412 Narrator: Isabelle is a lace inspector.
03:25:43.664 Lace right off the loom is never perfect,
03:25:46.000 so it's the inspector'sjob to spot any mistakes.
03:26:11.317 Narrator: These highly skilled workers
03:26:12.651 inspect every inch of the lace
03:26:14.695 and repair each section by hand.
03:26:18.115 The repairs must be indistinguishable
03:26:20.034 from the rest of the lace.
03:26:33.005 Narrator: Leavers lace with no additions
03:26:34.590 costs around $45 to $90 per square meter.
03:26:38.511 That's over ten times theprice of mass-produced lace.
03:26:42.681 But lace with add-ons likepearls, crystals, or sequins
03:26:45.976 can cost several hundred dollars more.
03:26:49.438 Dresses or lingerie made with Leavers lace
03:26:51.732 usually cost a few hundreddollars at minimum.
03:26:55.444 But some can cost a lot more.
03:27:05.621 Narrator: In addition to the materials
03:27:07.248 and complicated manufacturing,
03:27:09.041 the looms themselves increase the price.
03:27:12.837 Leavers looms aren't made today.
03:27:15.005 Companies have to maintainthe looms that they have.
03:27:18.175 It's not impossible tobuild a Leavers loom,
03:27:20.886 but the costs required to manufacture it
03:27:22.972 would be more than thedemand for the product.
03:27:25.724 Because of that, lace manufacturersrely on existing looms
03:27:29.520 and even share spareparts between companies.
03:27:33.107 But the lace industry in France
03:27:34.483 used to look a lot different.
03:27:37.361 In the early 20th century,
03:27:38.779 there were tens of thousandsof lace-related jobs.
03:27:42.241 But as production modernizedand fashion trends shifted,
03:27:45.619 the industry consolidatedto two main parts of France:
03:27:48.998 Caudry and Calais.
03:27:50.958 Today, only a few thousand jobs remain.
03:27:54.253 And only a handful of thetraditional lace producers
03:27:56.922 are left.
03:27:58.424 Competition from cheaperlace manufacturers
03:28:00.634 has eliminated a lot of the industry.
03:28:03.095 Many remaining producersfocus on the high-end market.
03:28:32.458 Narrator: Demand for Jean Bracq's lace
03:28:33.792 had actually been increasingfor the last few years.
03:28:36.921 But the COVID-19 pandemichit the industry hard.
03:28:41.217 Brands like Chanel and RalphLauren rely on companies
03:28:43.969 that can create Leavers lace.
03:28:45.846 But if demand doesn't increase,
03:28:47.515 it'll be difficult tomaintain the industry.
03:29:10.746 Narrator: This is one of the most
03:29:11.622 expensive woods in the world,
03:29:14.375 but it's really oneportion of a sandalwood log
03:29:17.044 that makes it so valuable.
03:29:19.088 To get to it, these mentirelessly chop away
03:29:21.590 the lighter outer layer of sapwood
03:29:24.552 until they're left with this:
03:29:26.178 the dark inner core
03:29:27.137 that makes a kilogram of Indiansandalwood cost $200 today.
03:29:31.642 This is where sandalwood'sunique fragrance comes from.
03:29:34.436 And when it's distilled,
03:29:35.646 it's used in all kinds of products,
03:29:37.773 from bath soaps to luxury-brand perfumes.
03:29:41.819 So what makes sandalwood'saroma so special?
03:29:44.822 And is that why the wood is so expensive?
03:29:52.037 Native to South India, Santalumalbum, or Indian sandalwood,
03:29:55.958 was used for hundreds of years
03:29:57.459 before becoming a go-toscent for expensive perfumes.
03:30:01.422 Today, it's used for woodcarvings and medicine,
03:30:04.258 and it's even considered asacred tree in several religions.
03:30:08.554 Once distilled, sandalwood'ssweet, woodsy aroma
03:30:11.473 retains its scent for decades.
03:30:25.279 Narrator: After harvesting,
03:30:26.322 the forestry departmentsells sandalwood at auction
03:30:29.116 to factories like this one in Mysore.
03:30:42.338 Narrator: Hollow heartwood logs
03:30:43.547 are classified as jajpokel,
03:30:45.507 one of the 18 classesof Indian sandalwood.
03:30:48.177 Factories can purchase pureheartwood, like jajpokel,
03:30:51.138 or raw sandalwood logs.
03:30:53.349 But if they buy the raw wood,
03:30:54.933 they'll need to breakdown each log themselves.
03:30:58.687 Although a machine helps split sandalwood
03:31:00.648 into more manageable pieces,
03:31:02.441 stripping the logs downto their heartwood core
03:31:04.943 requires the effort of several employees.
03:31:13.702 Narrator: In a physicallydemanding process,
03:31:15.496 these men chop each logto remove the sapwood,
03:31:18.290 the nonfragrant portion of sandalwood.
03:31:31.136 Narrator: Pure heartwoodis the most valuable class
03:31:33.305 of sandalwood.
03:31:34.932 In some trees, pure heartwoodis easier to extract
03:31:37.976 because it forms in onecircle at the center.
03:31:41.271 In other trees, the heartwoodmixes together with sapwood,
03:31:44.441 which impacts the final value of the oil.
03:32:05.254 Narrator: After employeeshave gathered all they can,
03:32:07.423 a machine breaks down thestrips of wood into chips.
03:32:10.759 Employees do a sift through these chips
03:32:12.678 to grab any leftoverpieces of usable heartwood.
03:32:16.515 Then a separate machine turnsthose chips into powder.
03:32:21.812 Now distillation can begin.
03:32:25.232 The process is long,
03:32:26.442 and it starts with injectingsteam into distillation stills.
03:32:30.904 After the oil is extracted,
03:32:32.573 all that's left are thesegiant mounds of powder.
03:32:36.118 But even with most of the oil gone,
03:32:37.911 some of the scent still lingers.
03:32:40.914 Rather than going to waste,
03:32:42.207 it's used to make incense sticks
03:32:43.876 and dhoop, a commonform of incense in India
03:32:46.670 used during religious rituals.
03:32:50.257 During the final stages,
03:32:51.592 workers separate the oil from water
03:32:53.510 and purify it until they're left
03:32:54.970 with a totally cleantank of sandalwood oil.
03:32:58.849 It takes Mahadeva's team about a week
03:33:00.893 to distill 1 metric ton of oil.
03:33:03.937 Tanks of the purified oil aresent to a lab in Bengaluru.
03:33:07.941 Here, researchers testeach batch for quality.
03:33:11.320 They smell samples of the oil
03:33:12.654 to confirm the aroma isconsistent across batches.
03:33:16.575 Sandalwood's unique and long-lasting scent
03:33:18.786 makes it compatible with awide range of other fragrances,
03:33:22.122 which is why it's anideal base for perfume.
03:33:37.679 Narrator: After the oil is tested,
03:33:39.056 it heads to another factory
03:33:40.516 where it will be used to make soap
03:33:42.184 for Karnataka Soap andDetergents Limited, or KS&DL.
03:33:46.730 Chidananda: OK, this isthe final finished oil.
03:33:49.817 It's the color of the oil thatthe finished-product perfume,
03:33:52.778 what we are using for MysoreSandal Soap's fragrance.
03:33:56.031 Narrator: KS&DL is oneof the biggest producers
03:33:57.825 of sandalwood oil products globally.
03:34:00.786 Although its primary focus is soap,
03:34:02.746 the company sells bottlesof just sandalwood oil too.
03:34:05.707 One 10-gram bottle of sandalwood oil
03:34:07.960 costs 5,500 rupees, or about $74.
03:34:45.330 Narrator: Compared to 2017,
03:34:46.874 a kilogram of Indian sandalwoodoil can cost double today.
03:34:50.752 And demand isn't slowing down,
03:34:52.713 with the market expected to reach
03:34:54.172 over $165 million by 2027.
03:34:58.135 Out of roughly 10 sandalwood species,
03:35:00.262 Indian sandalwood andAustralian sandalwood
03:35:02.806 have the largest commercial value.
03:35:04.975 The difference is the Indian species
03:35:06.977 has higher levels ofalpha- and beta-santalol,
03:35:09.813 the components in sandalwood
03:35:11.189 responsible for its lasting scent
03:35:13.108 and believed health benefits.
03:35:15.152 India used to dominate themarket for sandalwood oil
03:35:17.571 and oil-based products.
03:35:19.615 But in recent years,Australia, which grows both
03:35:22.200 the Indian and Australiansandalwood species,
03:35:24.703 has gained significantground in the market.
03:35:27.831 Although this might looklike a lot of sandalwood,
03:35:30.417 India's actually facing a supply shortage.
03:35:34.087 In fact, the supply is so limited
03:35:36.089 that this sandalwooddistillery only operated
03:35:38.550 for about four months in 2021.
03:35:41.970 And up until 2002,
03:35:43.597 it was illegal for privategrowers to plant sandalwood trees
03:35:46.975 in the southern states ofKarnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala.
03:35:51.897 With only a small amount ofgovernment-sanctioned replanting
03:35:55.067 alongside the overharvesting,India's supply suffered.
03:35:59.112 And since 2018, the specieshas been considered vulnerable,
03:36:02.532 one level above endangered.
03:36:04.785 Another factor that limitssupply and increases the price
03:36:08.288 is inherent to the way the tree grows.
03:36:10.666 Older trees tend to yield more oil,
03:36:13.126 which makes them preferablefor oil production.
03:36:15.837 Growers will typicallywait around 20 years
03:36:18.256 for a tree to mature.
03:36:19.925 This waiting period doesn't only limit
03:36:21.677 the quantity of sandalwood,
03:36:23.220 it also puts the trees at risk.
03:36:41.488 Narrator: Today, every tree
03:36:42.948 has to be registered with the government
03:36:44.992 and can't be harvested ortransported without permission.
03:36:48.578 But even these strict regulations
03:36:50.288 aren't enough to prevent theft.
03:36:53.458 According to Hinduism Today,
03:36:54.960 roughly 2,000 tons of smuggled sandalwood
03:36:57.504 passed through the black market in 2018.
03:37:01.216 To successfully growthe trees for decades,
03:37:03.760 farmers must pay the cost to protect them.
03:37:06.763 Here in the city of Mysore,
03:37:08.265 some trees are wrapped in barbed wire.
03:37:11.309 On top of this threat, harvestingthese trees isn't simple.
03:37:15.313 When a farmer has approval,
03:37:16.732 a government official must come in person
03:37:18.650 to uproot the entire tree.
03:37:21.278 None of the tree should be wasted,
03:37:23.155 particularly heartwoodin the trunk and roots,
03:37:25.782 since it holds the highest oil content.
03:37:28.577 In the end, the tree'stotal oil output isn't much.
03:37:49.222 Narrator: To replenish some of its trees,
03:37:50.766 the Karnataka state government
03:37:52.100 created the Grow More Sandalwood program.
03:38:08.158 Narrator: But growingtrees comes with the cost
03:38:10.202 of protecting them for decades at a time,
03:38:12.871 something that likelywill still deter farmers.
03:38:15.874 There are also the permissions
03:38:17.084 growers need from the government,
03:38:18.460 which slow down the process.
03:38:21.421 It's uncertain if programs like this
03:38:23.090 can return India to itsold production levels,
03:38:25.884 but at a minimum the effort might help
03:38:27.677 restore some of the country'slost sandalwood supply.
03:38:31.723 Narrator: Zellige tiles start out
03:38:32.933 as a simple mixture of clay and water.
03:38:36.937 But after several daysof painstaking work,
03:38:40.398 artisans chisel and transform them
03:38:42.400 into a complex work of art.
03:38:46.196 Compared to other popular tiles,
03:38:48.115 Zellige tiles aren't cheap.
03:38:50.700 A square foot can cost $50,
03:38:53.370 while ceramic subway tiles
03:38:54.955 might only cost around $0.15.
03:38:58.208 But this art form relieson the skilled artisans
03:39:00.919 that make each tile by hand.
03:39:03.880 Like Ahmed Al-Maghari,
03:39:05.632 who has been makingZellige tiles for 54 years.
03:39:10.345 So how are Zellige tiles made?
03:39:13.014 And is this what makes them so expensive?
03:39:20.647 While perfection is often valued,
03:39:22.983 it's the imperfect qualities of Zellige
03:39:25.610 that make the tiles so unique.
03:39:28.280 Artisans in Morocco have been
03:39:29.865 hand-making Zellige tiles for centuries.
03:39:33.827 Today, they continue thistradition in the city of Fez.
03:39:53.180 Narrator: But before artisansat Arabesque can create tiles,
03:39:56.516 they first need to form the clay.
03:40:00.395 Fez has remained a center for Zellige
03:40:02.522 partly because of these rocks.
03:40:04.816 They're considered some of thebest materials in the region
03:40:07.736 for making high-quality clay.
03:40:15.202 Narrator: This clay isbelieved to be more durable
03:40:17.287 than some clays found further south,
03:40:19.539 and it can withstand veryhigh temperatures once fired.
03:40:24.419 First, an artisan tosses the rocks
03:40:26.129 into a pit in the ground called a zuba.
03:40:29.591 They fill the zuba with water
03:40:31.092 and leave the rocks to soften for a day.
03:40:34.012 Then, in one of manytedious stages to come,
03:40:37.057 an artisan kneads the clay
03:40:38.391 using their hands and feetto make it more malleable.
03:40:45.190 After the clay has fermented for a day,
03:40:47.400 a different artisan hasthe task of molding it
03:40:49.945 into the proper shape.
03:41:04.376 The artisan places the clay into a mold,
03:41:07.003 smoothing it over with onehand so the surface is flat.
03:41:11.800 For every 10 kilograms of clay,
03:41:13.802 artisans can make over 10 square feet,
03:41:16.137 or about 1 meter, of tiles.
03:41:19.474 After molding hundreds of tiles,
03:41:21.726 they leave the clay to dry under the sun.
03:41:24.980 The next stage is vital
03:41:26.606 to ensuring the tiles will remain intact.
03:41:51.589 Narrator: Hitting the clay repeatedly
03:41:53.216 also removes air bubbles.
03:41:55.635 If the air isn't removed,the tile may break
03:41:58.430 when an artisan later tries to chisel it.
03:42:01.683 Once each piece is perfectly square,
03:42:03.810 the tiles dry again under the sun.
03:42:08.356 Finally, it's time for theclay to head to the kiln.
03:42:15.322 Precision is critical at this stage,
03:42:17.824 which is why just one personis trusted to lead the job.
03:42:48.605 Narrator: Abdelwahed glazes the tiles,
03:42:50.357 and then they're fired for a second time.
03:42:52.984 This second firing ensuresthe color won't fade.
03:42:56.321 It also gives Zellige tiles
03:42:57.822 one of their most distinct features.
03:43:00.617 Heat doesn't circulate evenly
03:43:02.077 in a traditional Moroccan kiln,
03:43:04.120 which is why each tile,
03:43:05.497 even those with the same color glaze,
03:43:07.582 will have a slightly different shade.
03:43:10.543 But these tiles are just getting started.
03:43:14.756 After glazing, the tilesmove on to the cutting stage,
03:43:18.385 where artisans trace the small shapes
03:43:20.220 they'll later carve.
03:43:22.722 Chiseling the tiles requirestotal concentration.
03:43:26.434 Artisans must carve eachpiece as cleanly as possible.
03:43:30.855 Otherwise, it may not fitproperly into the final design.
03:43:37.362 How well and efficiently this is done
03:43:39.864 depends on the expertise of the artisan
03:43:42.909 and a tool known as the menkach.
03:43:45.161 It's a combination of a hammer and an ax.
03:43:48.998 Because they're hand-chiseled,
03:43:50.500 no two Zellige tiles willlook exactly the same.
03:43:55.130 It's the prime featurethat distinguishes Zellige
03:43:57.674 from mass-produced tiles
03:43:59.342 that are notably uniform incolor, shape, and texture.
03:44:06.307 Arabesque first createsdesigns on the computer.
03:44:09.477 Then Ahmed uses a paperprintout as a guide
03:44:12.021 to assemble the final design on the floor.
03:44:17.110 Ahmed inserts eachindividual tile by hand,
03:44:20.280 like a puzzle piece,
03:44:23.700 making sure every tile
03:44:25.160 seamlessly fits next to its neighbor.
03:44:54.731 Narrator: After about 15 daysof assembling the pieces,
03:44:57.692 Ahmed can reveal the finished design.
03:45:21.007 Narrator: The final priceof a mosaic like this
03:45:23.009 is the sum of several factors,
03:45:25.261 including the number ofpieces and their shape.
03:45:29.098 This is the average, normal, 36 pieces.
03:45:32.227 The shape of it is very square.
03:45:33.728 So the price of it, it's very affordable.
03:45:36.814 Unlike if we go here, whichis made of stars and cross.
03:45:41.236 There are 36 pieces by 36.
03:45:43.738 So 36 pieces here also,but the price of this
03:45:47.242 is four times the price of the other one
03:45:48.993 because of the shape.
03:45:51.829 Narrator: Adil also considersthe size of the tiles
03:45:54.249 within a design.
03:45:55.792 Smaller pieces are not assimple to chisel by hand.
03:45:58.878 The smaller the tiles,
03:46:00.129 the more expensive the design will be.
03:46:02.840 Adil: There are areas whereyou have a square foot
03:46:06.261 that can have 64 pieces, 128 pieces,
03:46:09.597 360 pieces versus 36 pieces.
03:46:13.059 So if you have one thatcosts $10 per square foot,
03:46:15.812 the other one might cost 10 times,
03:46:18.022 $100 per square foot.
03:46:20.525 Narrator: The price increases further
03:46:22.026 for more complex designs.
03:46:24.404 Adil: This tile has an interlace.
03:46:26.573 The interlace is automaticallydouble the price.
03:46:29.200 So if you have a $10 square foot,
03:46:31.119 with the interlace, it's $20.
03:46:35.832 Narrator: Centuries ago,Zellige tiles were reserved
03:46:38.334 for royal palaces.
03:46:40.587 Today, they've becomesynonymous with Moroccan design.
03:46:44.549 You'll find them covering walls, floors,
03:46:46.801 and fountains across Fez.
03:46:49.721 Adil: When we talk about Morocco
03:46:51.264 and Moroccan architecture,
03:46:53.057 the first thing comes to mind is Zellige.
03:46:56.936 Narrator: But its influencegoes beyond Morocco.
03:47:00.189 Demand has grown in the US,especially in recent years,
03:47:03.735 as notable designers like Kelly Wearstler
03:47:06.237 incorporate Zellige into their own work.
03:47:09.532 But the way some are usingthe tiles is different.
03:47:12.243 Rather than mosaics,
03:47:13.536 they're creatingmonochromatic backsplashes.
03:47:16.664 Part of the appeal of usingjust one color of Zellige
03:47:19.584 is that it appears ombré
03:47:21.294 when multiple tiles come together,
03:47:23.338 thanks to their subtle variation in shade.
03:47:27.634 But while Zellige becomesmore popular overseas,
03:47:30.887 Adil struggles to findyoung people locally
03:47:33.389 he can trust with the trade.
03:47:36.768 Adil: This is more of a living art,
03:47:39.312 but it's also a dying tradition.
03:47:42.065 Nowadays, people are notpatient as much as in before.
03:47:46.569 If you look at the people whoused to work in this trade,
03:47:51.032 they're very calm. They're very peaceful.
03:47:53.618 They have inner peace.
03:47:54.911 Nowadays we find extreme hardship
03:47:59.415 to train and adapt people
03:48:03.378 who can carry this kind of tradition
03:48:05.963 as Zellige artisans.
03:48:45.503 Narrator: This is a handmade iron kettle.
03:48:49.549 For centuries, artisans have made kettles
03:48:51.884 by pouring molten iron
03:48:53.386 through a small openingin molds like this.
03:48:57.682 Once the iron hardens,
03:48:59.392 they continue the tedious work
03:49:01.102 of hammering the kettle free.
03:49:03.980 It's only used to boil water,
03:49:06.399 but that doesn't make it cheap.
03:49:08.776 You can buy a mass-producedkettle for $20,
03:49:11.863 but a handmade ironkettle can cost over $300.
03:49:16.617 So, who makes these kettles,
03:49:19.078 and why are they so expensive?
03:49:24.125 This is Iwate Prefecture in Japan.
03:49:27.128 Iron kettles have been madehere for hundreds of years.
03:49:30.923 Each one starts with a sketch.
03:49:34.552 Nobuho Miya runs Kamasada,
03:49:36.679 a workshop founded by his grandfather.
03:49:49.984 Narrator: Designing a new kettle
03:49:51.319 takes him two to three years.
03:50:19.889 Narrator: At this workshop,
03:50:20.848 every single kettle is made by hand.
03:50:24.060 But before you start meltingiron, you need a mold.
03:50:29.774 The mold is made from three parts
03:50:31.400 that form a gap wherethe iron is poured in.
03:50:56.259 Narrator: The core isdestroyed with each use,
03:50:58.553 but the outer molds arereused two to three times,
03:51:01.472 depending on the design of the kettle.
03:51:20.783 Narrator: According to Nobuho,
03:51:21.909 around 70% of the work is making the mold.
03:51:26.914 This process also creates
03:51:28.416 the most recognizableaspect of the design,
03:51:32.003 this bumpy pattern called arare.
03:51:36.257 This mold has around 2,000dots, all placed by hand.
03:52:01.824 Narrator: Artisans coatthe core with charcoal dust
03:52:04.035 to make it easier toseparate from the iron.
03:52:07.413 Then Shotaro delicately placesit inside the outer mold.
03:52:11.626 But he won't know if something went wrong
03:52:13.502 until the iron has cooled.
03:52:18.174 There's a lot of anticipationwaiting for the iron to melt.
03:52:23.054 Shotaro has to mentallyprepare for the pour,
03:52:26.057 a dangerous and physically demanding task.
03:52:32.355 A mistake here could ruin the kettle,
03:52:35.191 so experience andconfidence are essential.
03:53:03.469 Once the iron cools,
03:53:04.845 Shotaro finally sees theresult of his hard work.
03:54:06.073 Narrator: Traditionaliron kettles like this one
03:54:08.034 don't have any enamel coating inside.
03:54:11.037 Instead, artisans heat the kettle
03:54:12.788 to 900 degrees Celsiuson a bed of charcoal.
03:54:18.002 This creates an oxidized layer,which helps prevent rust.
03:54:22.965 Without an enamel coating,
03:54:24.467 the iron subtly changesthe taste of boiled water.
03:54:29.513 But this kettle isn't done yet.
03:54:32.475 The final stage is one of themost skill-intensive steps.
03:54:40.107 Nobuho heats up the kettleand brushes on lacquer,
03:54:42.943 coating and coloring the outside.
03:55:41.377 Narrator: Most kettles fromKamasada cost $300 to $400,
03:55:45.464 but prices can be as high as $2,000.
03:55:50.177 Despite the high price,customers appreciate
03:55:52.680 the slow-paced nature of these kettles.
03:55:56.267 The design is considered wabi-sabi,
03:55:58.310 which is difficult to translate literally
03:56:00.563 but refers to the conceptof appreciating imperfection
03:56:03.774 and practicing mindfulness.
03:56:43.522 Narrator: Iron kettleswere common in Japan
03:56:45.274 in the 17th and 18th centuries,
03:56:47.568 when they were used in tea ceremonies.
03:56:50.821 But they struggled tocompete with convenient
03:56:52.823 mass-produced options after World War II.
03:56:56.368 In recent years, interestin their aesthetic qualities
03:56:59.205 has reignited demand,
03:57:01.874 but that demand hasbrought on many knockoffs
03:57:04.251 that can be bought fora fraction of the price.
03:57:08.464 These kettles imitate the arare pattern
03:57:10.633 but usually aren't made in Japan.
03:57:14.220 They also have an enameled interior
03:57:16.222 instead of the bare iron usedin the traditional version.
03:57:20.351 But the original uncoated interior
03:57:22.686 is actually one of themain selling points.
03:57:26.232 Customers say they like the taste
03:57:27.650 of water boiled in these kettles.
03:57:29.818 And some also value the small amount
03:57:31.820 of iron content it adds to their water.
03:58:09.275 Narrator: Despite anincrease in popularity,
03:58:11.527 Nobuho says that demandfor this type of kettle
03:58:13.946 isn't enough to sustainthe business on its own.
03:58:51.108 Narrator: Shotaro, Nobuho's son,
03:58:53.027 has trained in making iron kettles
03:58:54.945 and plans on taking over the business
03:58:56.780 to continue this centuries-old craft.
03:59:29.271 Narrator: Right now, these jasmine buds
03:59:31.231 don't smell like anything.
03:59:33.692 But once they bloom,
03:59:35.027 producers in India processtheir coveted aroma
03:59:37.863 into one of the priciestoils in the world.
03:59:41.450 Just 1 kilogram of jasmine oil
03:59:43.911 can cost over $5,000.
03:59:47.331 It's a key ingredient in luxury perfumes.
03:59:51.126 But to get 1 kilogram of some jasmine oil,
03:59:54.088 these women need to pluck over 5,000 buds.
03:59:58.967 So, what does jasmine smell like?
04:00:02.137 And why is the oil so expensive?
04:00:08.811 For hundreds of years,jasmine has been used in India
04:00:11.897 to make garlands and headpiecesfor special occasions.
04:00:16.110 Its scent is sweet, fruity, and floral,
04:00:18.987 blending well with other fragrances.
04:00:22.116 And while India grows over80 varieties of jasmine,
04:00:25.911 jasmine grandiflorum and sambac
04:00:28.288 are two of the most commercially valuable.
04:00:31.959 Raja: It's been considered very divine.
04:00:34.002 And sambac especially,even amongst other flowers,
04:00:36.839 is considered one notch superior.
04:00:39.049 It's the most preferred flower.
04:00:42.553 Thierry: Jasmine sambac has this ease,
04:00:45.305 this friendliness, this happiness.
04:00:48.434 It is a joyful scent.
04:00:51.645 Narrator: Jasmine sambacthrives in Madurai,
04:00:54.356 the jasmine capital of India.
04:00:57.234 Like any flower, jasmineproduces a strong scent
04:01:00.487 only after it blooms.
04:01:02.781 But local sellers don'twant jasmine flowers.
04:01:05.576 They want the buds.
04:01:08.871 That's because once the flower blooms,
04:01:10.956 the scent only lasts a few days.
04:01:14.543 The buds last longer, sothey're easier to transport,
04:01:17.504 whether it be for garlandsor oil extraction.
04:01:21.925 Raja runs a jasmine-oil company.
04:01:24.761 But before Raja can produce the oil,
04:01:27.264 he'll need to wait for the day's harvest.
04:01:32.186 Jasmine is a night-blooming flower.
04:01:35.439 To maximize the harvest
04:01:36.899 and ensure the buds makeit to the markets in time,
04:01:39.818 harvesters head to the fields early.
04:01:43.822 Rathi is one of a handful of women
04:01:45.741 tasked with plucking the buds.
04:01:49.786 It's not as simple asgrabbing each bud she sees.
04:01:54.750 Raja: Only the right bud blooms that day.
04:01:57.294 Otherwise, it's not going to bloom.
04:01:59.087 So if it doesn't bloom, no fragrance.
04:02:02.883 Narrator: Decipheringwhich buds to harvest
04:02:04.760 requires a keen eye,
04:02:06.845 one that Rathi has trainedover the last 10 years
04:02:09.681 in these fields.
04:02:25.447 Narrator: Rathi goes toeach bush one by one,
04:02:28.283 plucking thousands of buds
04:02:29.826 before she collects a kilogram of jasmine.
04:02:33.622 Gathering that muchtakes her about an hour.
04:02:38.418 The work must be done gently, by hand,
04:02:40.712 so as not to damage the buds.
04:02:43.674 Damaged or wilted budsmean more work for Rathi.
04:02:49.096 Raja: Jasmine is a verylaborious picking process.
04:02:52.683 A kilo of jasmine, justto give you perspective,
04:02:55.936 will have about 5,000 to6,000 independent flowers.
04:02:58.981 So to pick 1 kilo, theyhave to move 5,000 times.
04:03:02.526 The hand moves back and forth 5,000 times
04:03:05.362 to pick just 1 kilo of flowers.
04:03:08.282 Narrator: But that's still a tiny fraction
04:03:10.033 of the buds needed toproduce a kilogram of oil.
04:03:13.829 For 1 kilogram of jasmine oil,
04:03:16.290 Raja needs 1 metric ton, or1,000 kilograms, of flowers.
04:03:22.004 As she works, Rathi collectsthe buds in her sari
04:03:25.090 to protect them andpreserve their fragrance.
04:03:45.819 Narrator: She'll harvest forabout five hours straight.
04:03:49.489 It's tedious and tiring,
04:03:51.533 but it's critical for her to keep moving
04:03:53.368 before it gets too hot.
04:03:56.580 Then the buds head to the local market.
04:04:12.429 Narrator: Murugan is used tothe market's chaotic energy.
04:04:15.891 He's been sourcing jasmine foroil production for 18 years.
04:04:21.063 Practically all corners ofthe market are full of buyers,
04:04:24.399 bags of jasmine buds,and scales to determine
04:04:27.110 the proper quantity for sale.
04:04:30.405 The rate today is 500 rupees per kilogram.
04:04:34.785 Before buying, heassesses the buds closely
04:04:37.245 to determine if the sizewill be worth the price.
04:04:58.558 Narrator: When the sun has set,
04:04:59.726 Raja's employees begin unloadingbags full of jasmine buds
04:05:03.230 back at the factory.
04:05:07.401 The first step is tospread them out with rakes,
04:05:10.112 and then again with their hands and feet.
04:05:13.990 Spreading out the buds iscrucial to preserving them.
04:05:17.577 Leaving them in a bigpile would generate heat,
04:05:20.247 which would again cause them to wilt.
04:05:25.043 Then Raja's team waits untilthe flowers begin to bloom.
04:05:30.132 Raja: The minute it starts blooming,
04:05:31.550 it starts emitting the fragrance.
04:05:33.677 And then, after some time,
04:05:35.011 you can see it emits a bad fragrance,
04:05:36.763 so you know there's aconstant chemical reaction
04:05:38.932 that's happening in the flower.
04:05:40.642 For us, it's so importantto capture the fragrance
04:05:43.270 at the right moment, whichis soon after it blooms,
04:05:46.440 which is best in termsof yield and the smell.
04:05:51.069 Narrator: Like severalother white flowers,
04:05:52.946 jasmine is rich in indole.
04:05:55.782 Ironically, indole is found in feces too.
04:05:59.745 In the case of feces,there's too much indole,
04:06:02.831 so it produces an unpleasant smell.
04:06:05.834 But in limited amounts, itcreates an appealing aroma,
04:06:09.212 as it does with jasmine.
04:06:13.759 When the jasmine has bloomed,
04:06:15.093 Raja's team loads the flowers
04:06:16.762 into four 5,000-liter extractors.
04:06:20.265 The flowers then soak in a solvent.
04:06:23.226 Once the solvent absorbsthe smell of the flowers,
04:06:25.729 they remove all of the liquid.
04:06:28.231 They're left with this waxy,hard substance called concrete.
04:06:32.360 It's what Raja uses tofinally extract the oil.
04:06:36.198 Raja: You add alcohol into the concretes,
04:06:38.241 and then the concrete isseparated off the waxes.
04:06:41.912 It's filtered, and thenwe get the absolute.
04:06:45.832 Narrator: Jasmine sambacis the most coveted
04:06:47.709 of all jasmine flowers,hence the high price.
04:06:51.630 At its peak, jasmine sambac flowers
04:06:54.007 can cost 10 times more thanother types of jasmine.
04:06:57.803 And when it comes to thefinal price of the oil,
04:07:00.263 the majority of it depends onthe cost of the flower itself.
04:07:04.059 Raja: About 60% of the bulk of the cost
04:07:06.228 is attributed towardsthe flower cost itself.
04:07:08.522 So it varies depending on the price
04:07:09.981 of the flowers every year.
04:07:10.982 The cost of 1 kilo of concrete
04:07:13.360 is around $2,750 to $3,000,
04:07:16.446 and the absolute is almost a double,
04:07:18.573 like $5,500-plus per kilo of absolute.
04:07:22.494 Narrator: But jasmine sambac oil
04:07:23.870 wasn't always this valuable.
04:07:26.373 In fact, Raja says it was rarely harvested
04:07:29.084 before the launch ofDior's J'Adore fragrance.
04:07:32.963 Raja: That was when thesambac became the in thing.
04:07:35.549 Before that, sambac was grown in India,
04:07:37.759 but it was not really extracted.
04:07:39.886 Narrator: Today, jasmine-oilextracts travel from India
04:07:43.098 all the way to Paris,where they will be used
04:07:45.350 in many high-end fragrances,particularly at Guerlain.
04:07:49.896 Guerlain sources jasminesambac oil directly from Raja.
04:07:54.109 Thierry: The signature of thehouse is made with jasmine
04:07:57.654 and five other ingredients.
04:07:59.865 So jasmine is almost everywhere.
04:08:03.118 Narrator: The company producesall of its fragrance blends
04:08:05.453 in-house, including Mon Guerlain.
04:08:08.874 Thierry: Jasmine sambac isthe star of Mon Guerlain.
04:08:13.587 You have the top note of lavender
04:08:16.256 blend then in the jasminesambac floralcy and joy.
04:08:21.177 Then comes the sandalwood and the vanilla.
04:08:23.972 This is such a soft andbeautiful fragrance.
04:08:31.146 Narrator: It takesbetween one to two months
04:08:33.064 for Hisao Manabe to dye thesethreads a deep indigo blue.
04:08:40.530 Denim made from these threadswill maintain this rich color,
04:08:43.992 and so will Manabe'snails for three weeks.
04:08:47.579 That's because Manabe uses real indigo
04:08:50.081 instead of the synthetic dyes
04:08:51.625 most jeans are made with today.
04:08:54.794 A pair of Momotaro jeansdyed with natural indigo
04:08:57.923 can cost over $2,000.
04:09:01.259 But using real indigo is just one element
04:09:04.095 that can raise theprice of Japanese denim.
04:09:07.974 Each stage of productionrequires meticulous attention.
04:09:12.145 So what exactly makesJapanese denim different?
04:09:15.482 And is that enough tomake it so expensive?
04:09:22.155 In basic terms, Japanese denim
04:09:24.574 refers to denim made in Japan.
04:09:27.327 But today, it often implies selvage denim.
04:09:32.290 The name comes fromthe way fabric is woven
04:09:34.751 on these old shuttle looms.
04:09:37.837 They weave fabric with asealed, or self-finished, edge,
04:09:41.549 hence the name selvage.
04:09:44.636 It means the end of thefabric won't fray or unravel.
04:09:48.473 You'll notice a pair ofselvage jeans by the cuff.
04:09:51.518 There's typically a coloredline along the outseam.
04:10:03.238 Narrator: This type of denimis made here in Kojima, Japan.
04:10:14.874 Narrator: Momotaro is one of Kojima's
04:10:16.376 most well-known denim brands.
04:10:18.962 But before Momotaro makes denim,
04:10:21.172 it must first dye the threads.
04:10:25.051 The company's most expensive jeans
04:10:26.928 are hand-dyed with natural indigo.
04:10:29.681 Natural indigo comes from the leaves
04:10:31.474 of the Indigofera plant.
04:10:33.685 Dyeing fabric with natural indigo
04:10:35.395 has been a valued art formin Japan for centuries.
04:10:52.620 Narrator: Manabe dyes 60 rollsof cotton over several days.
04:10:56.916 He wrings each roll outand hangs it up to dry
04:10:59.502 before dyeing another.
04:11:13.391 Narrator: Manabe must dye each roll
04:11:14.684 a total of about 30 times.
04:11:17.020 Otherwise, the color won'tbe a dark enough blue.
04:11:22.734 Dyeing jeans this waydoesn't only take longer;
04:11:25.695 it also costs more.
04:11:30.450 A kilogram of some synthetic indigo
04:11:32.368 can cost between $4 and $5.
04:11:35.330 Depending on the quality,
04:11:36.664 natural indigo might cost 10 times that.
04:11:47.717 Narrator: That one bale is only enough
04:11:49.427 to dye about 15 pairs of jeans.
04:11:52.931 Although using natural dyeraises the cost of production,
04:11:56.184 it has unique effects on jeans
04:11:58.061 that can't be produced by synthetic dyes.
04:12:22.001 Narrator: Today, cheaper synthetic dyes
04:12:23.962 have mostly replaced natural ones,
04:12:26.381 so jeans still made with natural dyes
04:12:28.800 are often considered a premium product.
04:12:32.262 Which is partly why Momotaro's kintin,
04:12:34.806 or gold-label jeans,are worth over $2,000.
04:12:38.935 The increased price of this pair
04:12:41.020 is a nod to the extraeffort, skill, and money
04:12:44.482 needed to dye the threads by hand
04:12:46.693 and get the color just right.
04:12:52.615 Not all Japanese denim or Momotaro jeans
04:12:55.743 are made with natural indigo,
04:12:58.037 but even so, the price remains high,
04:13:00.582 around $200 to $300 for a pair like this.
04:13:04.919 And that goes back to theway Japanese denim is woven.
04:13:13.845 Before Toyota made cars,it made looms like this.
04:13:18.308 Originally introduced in the 1920s,
04:13:20.810 these Toyoda looms areno longer made today.
04:13:29.652 And although they look and sound
04:13:31.696 like they're working fast ...
04:13:35.617 weaving fabric this waytakes five times longer
04:13:38.661 than weaving on modern projectile looms.
04:14:06.564 Narrator: Despite thelooms being automated,
04:14:08.650 an experienced Momotaro technician
04:14:10.985 has to keep a close eyeon them as they run.
04:14:14.614 He checks to see eachloom is working smoothly
04:14:17.325 and that all the threadsare aligned correctly.
04:14:21.037 Even so, it's possiblesomething will go wrong.
04:14:39.472 Narrator: On top of weaving slowly,
04:14:41.182 the looms produce fabricless than a yard wide.
04:14:44.143 That's about half thewidth of non-selvage denim,
04:14:47.063 so producers need more fabric
04:14:48.690 to make a pair of selvage jeans.
04:14:55.154 This is yet another factor
04:14:56.781 that increases the cost of production
04:14:58.783 and ultimately the finalprice of the jeans.
04:15:02.161 Selvage shuttle loomsare also less precise
04:15:04.372 than projectile looms.
04:15:06.332 But variations in the fabricmake each yard unique.
04:15:10.753 And, ironically, that'swhat gives these jeans
04:15:13.172 one of their biggest appeals.
04:15:15.717 While most other jeanshave a smooth surface,
04:15:18.344 Japanese denim is a little bit rougher.
04:15:31.232 Narrator: While most Momotaro jeans
04:15:32.775 are made on the automated looms,
04:15:34.736 the most expensive gold-label jeans
04:15:36.863 are produced with an evenslower, more traditional method:
04:15:41.159 by hand, with an antique loom.
04:15:44.203 It takes one hour for Kazuki Ikeda
04:15:46.831 to weave just 10 centimeters of fabric.
04:15:50.960 While this process raises the price,
04:15:53.046 the extra effort gives the jeans
04:15:54.839 a distinctly different feel.
04:16:17.862 Narrator: And for denim enthusiasts,
04:16:19.113 traveling from Thailandto Tokyo is worth the trip
04:16:22.241 to buy Momotaro's most expensive pair.
04:16:43.888 Narrator: After thefabric is woven by hand
04:16:45.890 or selvage shuttle loom, itheads to the sewing room.
04:16:51.896 According to Heddels, on average,
04:16:54.107 most other types of denimweigh between 11 and 14 ounces,
04:16:58.277 while most denim fromJapan weighs 20 ounces.
04:17:01.989 A heavier fabric makesNaomi Takebayashi's job
04:17:05.243 more challenging.
04:17:32.353 Narrator: Anothercornerstone of Japanese denim
04:17:34.522 is the artisanal nature
04:17:35.898 of the way the jeans are finally formed.
04:17:41.654 At Momotaro, all thestitching is done by hand.
04:17:49.954 The same goes for addingeach copper rivet.
04:17:54.333 The final look and feel of a finished pair
04:17:57.170 largely depend on Takebayashi'sdedication to detail.
04:18:03.718 Because selvage looms are less precise,
04:18:05.970 the fabric will naturallyhave several imperfections.
04:18:10.349 But if Momotaro's retail stores
04:18:12.268 find anything wrong with a pair of jeans,
04:18:14.854 they mark it with a small sticker
04:18:16.606 and send it here, to thequality control room.
04:18:20.026 Takebayashi siftsthrough the flagged jeans
04:18:22.320 using a tweezer torepair each marked spot.
04:18:27.366 Momotaro is one of around40 denim makers in Kojima,
04:18:30.870 considered the birthplaceof denim in Japan.
04:18:33.623 While Japanese denim from this city
04:18:35.583 has found a luxurycategory to call its own,
04:18:38.544 the denim industry hasn't been prominent
04:18:40.546 in Kojima for very long.
04:19:16.165 Narrator: In the decades since,
04:19:17.416 Japanese denim hasreached far outside Japan.
04:19:21.128 Today, it's considered one of the finest
04:19:23.297 types of denim in the world.
04:19:27.260 Narrator: One way to make shea butter
04:19:28.636 involves pounding and grindingdry shea nuts by hand.
04:19:34.725 Another way requires twopeople to push a lever
04:19:38.145 as a cold-press machine turns shea nut oil
04:19:40.690 into a creamy pale-yellow butter.
04:19:43.818 Regardless of the way it's done,
04:19:45.319 producing shea butter is tedious work.
04:19:48.030 And depending on how it's made,
04:19:49.574 it can cost over $50 a kilo.
04:19:52.785 But this isn't just any shea butter.
04:19:54.996 This is East African shea butter,
04:19:57.123 the most expensive version ofthe commonly known product.
04:20:01.002 So, what makes East Africanshea butter different?
04:20:04.005 And why is it so expensive?
04:20:08.175 When someone hears "shea butter,"
04:20:09.969 it's likely they think ofthe West African variety.
04:20:13.598 But in East Africa, a differentkind of shea nut grows,
04:20:17.143 a subspecies called nilotica.
04:20:19.979 The West African paradoxa tree is farmed,
04:20:22.607 so it grows more abundantly,
04:20:24.817 but nilotica isn't typically planted.
04:20:27.737 It grows in the wild inEast African countries
04:20:30.281 like Uganda and Sudan.
04:20:32.658 East African shea buttercan cost more than double
04:20:35.119 the West African alternative.
04:20:37.455 That's because it's easier to spread
04:20:39.540 and absorbs quickly into the skin.
04:20:42.293 Lucy: This is our nilotica.
04:20:44.420 Very low melting point, like you see.
04:20:47.923 When I spread, it easily melts.
04:20:50.176 And within a few minutes
04:20:51.677 it will have sunk into my skin pores.
04:20:55.348 But when we come to
04:20:57.516 our West African shea butter,
04:21:00.770 when you spread, this is how it turns out.
04:21:04.065 It'll remain on top becauseof the waxy texture.
04:21:07.902 Narrator: That makesnilotica more desirable
04:21:10.071 for cosmetics companies,
04:21:11.530 which use it for butters, oils, and soaps.
04:21:15.034 And according to Lucy,this is one of the reasons
04:21:17.203 demand for East Africanshea butter has grown
04:21:19.413 both locally and abroad.
04:21:21.582 In Uganda, niloticaproducers are trying to meet
04:21:24.585 the growing demand.
04:21:35.680 Narrator: Akello and her peers
04:21:36.889 have been harvestingshea fruits since 5 a.m.
04:21:40.142 They're part of the CornerAdwari Mooyao Women's Group,
04:21:43.270 a self-help group for women in Uganda.
04:21:46.816 In Uganda, shea producers are primarily
04:21:49.360 organized women's groups like this.
04:21:52.488 They start their day early
04:21:53.948 so they can pick the bestfruits before other groups come.
04:21:58.244 Akello and the other harvesters
04:21:59.745 pick the fruits off the ground,
04:22:01.497 once they've already fallen.
04:22:04.709 Then they remove -- and eat —
04:22:07.086 the fruit to reveal the shea nut.
04:22:09.797 They eat it because they won'tneed it to make the butter,
04:22:12.466 and it's delicious.
04:22:20.266 Narrator: Quality control starts here,
04:22:21.976 with only the best shea nutsmoving on to processing.
04:22:25.813 These are grade-A nuts,
04:22:27.440 which are whole, undamaged,and untouched by insects.
04:22:32.027 The nuts are then driedin the sun for a few days
04:22:34.447 to reduce moisture.
04:22:37.366 Next, they're carefully cracked
04:22:39.160 and the kernels are driedagain for two weeks.
04:22:43.789 Now Akello can make the shea butter.
04:22:47.084 It's usually done one of two ways,
04:22:49.503 by hand or by machine,
04:22:52.715 both requiring heavy manual labor.
04:22:56.927 Making shea butter by handis an intensive process.
04:23:01.140 After the nuts dry the second time,
04:23:03.142 producers heat ash overa fire for 30 minutes.
04:23:07.730 Then they roast the shea nuts in the ashes
04:23:09.899 for another 45 minutes,stirring constantly.
04:23:14.653 This helps prevent mold
04:23:16.030 and deactivates free fatty acids, or FFAs,
04:23:19.992 which are harmful to the body.
04:23:22.453 But they have to be careful.
04:23:24.622 Too much heat could lead to a dark oil
04:23:26.957 with high, rather thandeactivated, FFA levels.
04:23:32.046 Then the women spread the nutson the ground to cool off.
04:23:41.806 Producers grind the nuts three times.
04:23:45.643 They take turns pounding,
04:23:47.019 then muddle the mixturefurther between rocks,
04:23:54.151 and, finally, refinethe mixture in a mill.
04:23:57.738 This creates a paste, whichthey pour into hot water.
04:24:03.285 Here, the oil they need for the butter
04:24:05.204 separates from the paste.
04:24:29.603 Narrator: The oil is removedand packaged for sale locally,
04:24:32.106 where a kilo costs over $5.
04:24:34.900 It's mainly used for cooking,
04:24:36.735 but locals also use it on their skin.
04:24:39.405 And while it's still pricierthan West African shea butter,
04:24:42.491 this heat-processed butter isa more affordable alternative
04:24:45.619 to cold-pressed nilotica.
04:24:47.997 1 kilo of cold-pressedEast African shea butter
04:24:50.499 can reach $12 in Uganda,
04:24:53.210 and when exported, it'sover four times that price.
04:24:57.256 That's because cold-pressedshea butter is more refined.
04:25:00.426 It's the cleanest way to extract the oil,
04:25:02.970 which preserves the nuts' properties.
04:25:11.854 After harvesting, drying,and grinding the shea nuts,
04:25:14.940 producers place them in cloth bags
04:25:16.942 and load them into a cold-press machine.
04:25:21.655 They've had this machine since 1997.
04:25:30.372 To use it, two people need to push
04:25:32.207 each side of the lever in a circle,
04:25:35.461 pressing and releasing the oil
04:25:37.129 from the fat in the shea nuts.
04:25:46.639 When left to rest, the oilhardens into shea butter.
04:25:50.309 From nut to butter, the wholeprocess can take three weeks.
04:25:55.481 Today, producers preferthe cold-press method
04:25:58.067 because they can make bigger batches
04:25:59.693 of high-quality shea butter.
04:26:02.071 It can also enhance some of the butter's
04:26:03.739 most desired properties.
04:26:06.241 Studies of nilotica have found
04:26:07.993 that it has significantlyhigher oleic acid content
04:26:10.996 than West African shea butter.
04:26:13.457 It also has lower stearic acid content,
04:26:15.918 which contributes to thesoftness of the butter.
04:26:19.171 This is the West African shea butter,
04:26:21.465 with a high melting point.
04:26:23.384 And when it solidifies, it's really hard.
04:26:26.637 Narrator: Harder texturesare more difficult
04:26:28.430 to integrate into cosmetics.
04:26:31.183 Lucy says that's why nilotica
04:26:33.018 has the upper hand in cosmetics.
04:26:35.354 Her American buyers prefer it
04:26:37.064 because it absorbs faster into the skin.
04:26:40.359 But nilotica has other special properties.
04:26:43.404 The demand at the moment is growing
04:26:46.490 because of these contents.
04:26:48.325 The olein, vitamin E,
04:26:50.744 and then it also has antioxidants
04:26:54.581 that make it easy.
04:26:56.041 Especially for cosmetics,
04:26:57.376 it has to have a healing factor within it.
04:27:01.422 Narrator: This growing demand is being met
04:27:02.965 with limited supply.
04:27:04.967 The supply is a little lower
04:27:07.720 because the number ofproducers is still a bit low.
04:27:13.726 Narrator: The shea treefruits only once a year,
04:27:15.978 and producers are still figuring out
04:27:17.521 how to bulk their harvests.
04:27:19.815 And while some efforts areunderway to farm more shea trees,
04:27:23.193 the nuts are primarilyharvested in the wild,
04:27:25.904 limiting producers further.
04:27:28.699 Then there's deforestation.
04:27:30.909 According to the UgandanNational Forest Authority,
04:27:33.495 the country has lost 63% of its tree cover
04:27:36.331 in the past 25 years.
04:27:39.126 Locals use the wood forcharcoal, firewood, and timber.
04:27:43.005 But nilotica producers hopethat as demand continues to grow
04:27:46.550 and locals learn moreabout nilotica's value,
04:27:49.094 they'll work to preserve the trees
04:27:51.305 and in turn scale up productionof East African shea butter.
04:27:57.519 Narrator: In Carrara, Italy,extracting calacatta marble
04:28:00.314 doesn't always go as planned.
04:28:08.197 Narrator: It'll take more work to fix,
04:28:10.157 but luckily, it's still usable.
04:28:12.910 And in four days, it'll be processed
04:28:14.578 into one of the most expensivemarble slabs in the world.
04:28:18.999 Just one slab can cost over $10,000.
04:28:23.796 So how is calacatta mined from mountains?
04:28:27.091 And what makes it so expensive?
04:28:32.805 Marble has been used for centuries
04:28:34.807 by artists and designers.
04:28:36.934 But calacatta marble isn'tjust any kind of marble.
04:28:40.854 A square foot of somecalacatta can cost over $400,
04:28:45.067 more than four times the priceof high-end Carrara marble,
04:28:48.320 which is mined in the same mountains.
04:28:50.614 Its warm, ivory-white background
04:28:52.866 and thick gold or gray veins
04:28:54.827 set calacatta apart from other marbles.
04:28:57.996 But the key to calacatta'sprice is its rarity.
04:29:02.251 It's found only in the Apuan mountains
04:29:04.211 of Carrara, Italy.
04:29:06.130 Marble has been minedhere for over 2,000 years.
04:29:10.634 Extracting calacattamarble from the mountains
04:29:13.011 requires decades of experience.
04:29:16.181 Enrico has been a miner for 40 years.
04:29:19.560 He learned from his father,
04:29:21.019 who worked at the same quarry.
04:29:33.282 Narrator: It's important thatminers have a trained eye
04:29:35.659 and are precise.
04:29:37.578 They need to work aroundthe mountain's defects
04:29:39.580 to avoid the risk of the marble breaking.
04:29:42.499 These flaws affect wherethe miners can extract,
04:29:45.043 how much they can extract,
04:29:46.712 and, eventually, how much they can sell.
04:30:09.151 Narrator: Despite Enrico'scare and attention,
04:30:11.278 he doesn't always get the result he wants.
04:30:29.338 Narrator: But before theycan detach the block,
04:30:31.423 they have to drill and saw.
04:30:34.134 In the first stage of extraction,
04:30:35.928 miners use drills to makestrategic holes in the mountain.
04:30:40.432 They then run diamond braidcords through these holes,
04:30:43.185 cutting the marble into a block.
04:30:45.812 The machinery is keptwet to protect the marble
04:30:48.273 as chainsaws help detachthe block from the mountain.
04:30:52.069 An average block is 12 cubic meters
04:30:54.404 and can weigh 36 metric tons.
04:30:58.033 It's then carefully loaded into a truck,
04:31:00.369 which brings it to a processing facility.
04:31:04.831 Here, the calacatta marbleblocks are sliced into slabs.
04:31:08.794 At this stage, processorscan't afford to make a mistake
04:31:12.005 and risk ruining the raremarble delivered to them.
04:31:15.384 They mount over 100 verythin blades onto a wet saw,
04:31:19.179 and the cutting begins.
04:31:22.683 The saw cuts slabs asthin as 2 centimeters.
04:31:25.894 Then they're prepared forshaping and polishing.
04:31:30.148 The slabs are firstsanded and pre-smoothed.
04:31:33.193 Then they're prepared for resination,
04:31:35.112 or the application of resin
04:31:36.571 to fill any cracks or holes in the slab.
04:31:40.701 It's also used to attach broken pieces,
04:31:43.328 like the ones that cracked at the quarry.
04:31:54.506 Narrator: And with marbleas rare as calacatta,
04:31:56.800 one mistake can have abig impact on the quality
04:31:59.594 and final price of the slab.
04:32:31.960 Narrator: After Sergiochecks that the resin
04:32:33.587 was applied evenly,
04:32:35.005 he moves it under UV light to dry.
04:32:37.841 These steps ensure thatthe slab has no flaws.
04:32:55.108 Narrator: Then the calacattaslab reaches its final stage.
04:32:58.904 It's honed and polisheduntil it almost sparkles,
04:33:02.115 becoming, as Sergiosays, shiny to the eye.
04:33:06.161 It's now ready to be sent to the buyer.
04:33:10.248 Calacatta is extracted andprocessed on a per-order basis.
04:33:14.461 Producers consult the customerevery step of the way.
04:33:18.465 This way, the calacattais perfectly customized
04:33:21.008 to the client's needs.
04:33:22.510 Because once it's fullyprocessed, there's no going back.
04:33:27.516 Even with these risks and high costs,
04:33:29.893 customers still want calacatta.
04:33:33.730 Our customers prefer calacattabecause it's a luxury,
04:33:37.609 it's a high-end product,
04:33:39.444 it's timeless, and it's classical.
04:33:41.654 It fits very well withany kind of furniture.
04:33:44.908 Narrator: White marbles likecalacatta are more desirable
04:33:47.452 because they have fewerflaws than darker marbles,
04:33:50.038 so they require lessmaintenance and repairs.
04:33:53.291 Calacatta is in even higher demand
04:33:55.168 than other white marbles, like Carrara.
04:33:58.004 The veins look crisper, less faded.
04:34:00.757 There are generallyfewer veins in calacatta,
04:34:02.843 making it easier to incorporate
04:34:04.428 in exterior and interior design.
04:34:07.472 And it has a softer contrastthan other high-end marbles,
04:34:10.724 like Statuario, whichhas a milky background,
04:34:13.603 darker gray veining, andfewer changes in color.
04:34:17.774 Memo: This is a typical use of calacatta.
04:34:20.485 It is made in this case tomake kitchen countertop.
04:34:23.989 And you can see thetypical calacatta vein.
04:34:28.034 Narrator: But certain calacattais even more expensive.
04:34:31.788 Calacatta gold, referringto the vein color,
04:34:34.875 is especially hard to find.
04:34:37.210 While standard calacattacan cost over $10,000,
04:34:40.714 a calacatta gold slab can reach
04:34:42.549 more than $29,000.
04:34:45.969 And while specific pricing isconsidered an industry secret,
04:34:49.389 Memo says selling isn't an issue.
04:34:52.850 Memo: In the last 40 years,
04:34:54.311 demand for calacattahas actually increased.
04:34:57.731 And even during times of crisis,
04:35:00.025 people have had a big desirefor this type of material.
04:35:04.321 Narrator: But this growingdemand isn't welcomed
04:35:06.280 by everyone, especially Carrara locals.
04:35:09.910 Sawing extraction techniqueshave led to slurry and waste
04:35:12.996 being carried to nearbyenvironments through runoff water.
04:35:16.750 This has impacted local groundwater
04:35:19.002 and the people who need it.
04:35:21.420 And environmentalistswarn the overexploitation
04:35:23.840 of the mountains willonly make things worse.
04:35:27.719 But that hasn't shakendemand for calacatta,
04:35:30.180 or marble in general.
04:35:32.516 The global marble marketis estimated to grow
04:35:35.018 to $68.5 billion by 2027.
04:35:40.814 Narrator: Sculpting, glazing, and firing
04:35:45.195 are just a few of thelabor-intensive steps
04:35:47.948 required to make ceramics.
04:35:51.367 Handmade ceramic dinnerware isn't cheap,
04:35:54.412 but porcelain dinnerwarecan be even more expensive.
04:35:58.958 The price of porcelain varies,
04:36:00.961 but some dishware, like this plate,
04:36:03.255 can cost over $400.
04:36:06.591 So how are ceramics made,
04:36:09.009 and why is porcelain so expensive?
04:36:14.848 There's a good chance that yousit on porcelain every day.
04:36:18.478 It's the most common materialused to make toilets.
04:36:22.357 The reason why
04:36:23.525 is also why it's a popularchoice for dishware.
04:36:27.362 Compared to other ceramics,
04:36:29.029 porcelain is more durable and nonporous,
04:36:32.284 so it lasts a long timeand it's easy to clean.
04:36:36.496 It has a distinct white color,
04:36:38.415 and unlike opaque stoneware,some porcelain is translucent.
04:36:43.128 The secret to thesedifferences is in the clay.
04:36:47.007 Clay used for porcelain
04:36:48.425 contains a high percentage of kaolin.
04:36:51.428 This is what makes porcelain white.
04:36:53.930 Kaolin is found all over the world,
04:36:56.348 but large high-quality deposits are rare.
04:37:20.956 Narrator: Porcelain isoften referred to as china,
04:37:23.418 which is where it was first created.
04:37:26.420 But today, it's made all over the world.
04:37:31.133 This is the Arita Porcelain Lab in Japan.
04:37:34.637 Artisans young and oldhave made porcelain here
04:37:37.098 for over 200 years.
04:37:44.022 There are countlessrecipes for porcelain clay,
04:37:46.815 but in addition to kaolin,
04:37:48.360 they usually containmaterials like quartz,
04:37:50.862 feldspar, and ball clay.
04:37:53.114 Each one changes theproperties of the clay.
04:37:56.201 Ball clay makes it more malleable,
04:37:58.243 and feldspar helps it becomeglass-like when fired.
04:38:02.165 The whitest translucent clays
04:38:03.832 need to be free from impurities
04:38:05.835 and generally cost morethan other ceramic clays.
04:38:09.756 But even for experienced potters,
04:38:11.841 porcelain can be tricky to work with.
04:38:16.221 In order to produce alarge number of pieces,
04:38:18.807 this workshop has an artisan
04:38:20.308 for each specific step in the process.
04:38:24.354 Even though 10 people work on each piece,
04:38:26.981 producing new dishwarecan take over a month.
04:38:54.926 Narrator: Compared to other ceramics,
04:38:56.635 many porcelain clays arechallenging to mold by hand.
04:39:01.098 It's also more proneto cracks when drying.
04:39:06.312 To help with this, and toproduce more uniform pieces,
04:39:09.565 this workshop uses moldsfor complex shapes.
04:39:14.487 Katsumi Yamashita has beenworking with porcelain
04:39:17.407 for 60 years.
04:39:42.557 Narrator: One of thosedifficult steps is glazing.
04:39:49.272 Glazing seals the clay,
04:39:50.899 but it also adds color and patterns,
04:39:53.651 and it's one of the reasons
04:39:54.652 that ceramics can be so expensive.
04:39:58.239 At this workshop, each designis delicately painted by hand.
04:40:47.580 Narrator: Another challengein making porcelain
04:40:49.666 is temperature.
04:40:51.417 In order to achievethat glass-like surface,
04:40:54.212 porcelain is fired at a higher temperature
04:40:56.548 than most other ceramics,
04:40:58.675 usually around 1,300 degrees Celsius.
04:41:02.846 At this workshop, piecesare fired three times,
04:41:06.266 a lengthy but crucial process.
04:41:09.811 The first firing is done without glaze,
04:41:12.146 at 950 degrees for two days.
04:41:15.775 Slow firing ensures thatpieces don't break in the kiln.
04:41:20.530 Once they've been fired,
04:41:21.656 artisans apply what's called underglaze.
04:41:28.496 The main firing, at 1,300degrees, takes three days.
04:41:33.501 Loading this kiln is a daunting task,
04:41:36.421 but it has to be done carefully.
04:41:38.256 Otherwise, pieces couldbe destroyed inside.
04:41:49.475 Thankfully, this firing was a success.
04:41:54.230 Now the final design starts to take shape.
04:42:26.471 Narrator: The price of porcelain varies
04:42:27.889 based on the size andcomplexity of the design.
04:42:30.934 A simple rice bowl costs around $7,
04:42:34.479 but the most expensiveplatter from this workshop
04:42:37.023 costs a few thousand dollars.
04:42:40.109 This blue and white design
04:42:41.569 is a traditional look for porcelain,
04:42:43.988 but in order to maintaininterest in this ancient craft,
04:42:46.950 the Arita Porcelain Lab has tried
04:42:48.618 to create more contemporary designs
04:42:50.870 that fit into a modern home.
04:43:27.615 Narrator: In the forests of South India,
04:43:29.325 harvesters climb trees as tall as 50 feet
04:43:32.120 to handpick these clove buds.
04:43:36.833 When exported, less than half a pound
04:43:38.835 of these dried cloves costs $30.
04:43:42.296 That's 10 times as much as some cumin.
04:43:45.341 But as they focus onkeeping their balance,
04:43:47.677 harvesters must also becareful not to break the buds.
04:43:51.639 If they do, the value of theclove drops significantly,
04:43:55.393 and that's just where the risk begins.
04:43:58.604 To harvest cloves correctly,
04:44:00.106 workers put their lives on the line.
04:44:03.401 So what makes cloves worth the risks?
04:44:06.404 And why are they so expensive?
04:44:12.869 Cloves are the flower buds of clove trees
04:44:15.121 that haven't blossomed yet.
04:44:16.789 When dried, they'recommonly used as a spice.
04:44:20.793 A clove's flavor is complex,
04:44:22.545 with notes of sweetness,bitterness, and heat.
04:44:25.673 The oil found in cloveshas medicinal properties
04:44:28.426 that make the spice valuableoutside of just cooking.
04:44:31.596 Cloves with the round head,or crown, still intact
04:44:34.640 have the most oil.
04:44:36.476 But to get cloves with thehighest possible oil content,
04:44:39.729 highly skilled workersare needed at every stage.
04:44:55.787 Narrator: To get to the top of the trees,
04:44:57.705 harvesters like Shibu rely ononly a ladder and some rope.
04:45:14.138 Narrator: He reinforces thebottom of the ladder with mud,
04:45:16.724 so it doesn't move as henavigates the tall tree.
04:45:20.394 Shibu ties a sack to his waist,
04:45:22.146 and then he starts his climb,
04:45:23.731 working his way from the topof the tree to the bottom.
04:45:31.447 Harvesters can't picktoo soon or too late,
04:45:34.200 or the cloves will dropin grade and value.
04:45:37.411 In addition to pickingat the exact right time
04:45:40.039 and being careful notto harm the clove bud,
04:45:42.416 they need to be sure
04:45:43.376 not to break the tree branches they climb.
04:45:45.962 Otherwise, the treewill have a lower yield
04:45:48.422 next harvesting season.
04:45:52.510 Navigating all these elementscan be extremely dangerous.
04:45:57.473 In Blackrock Estates, harvestingcloves has led to death.
04:46:19.954 Narrator: Yet handpicking is the only way
04:46:21.831 farms like Blackrock Estate have managed
04:46:24.125 to keep delivering quality cloves.
04:46:28.963 Because timing is crucial,Charles needs a big team
04:46:31.966 to pick the cloves assoon as they're ready,
04:46:34.427 which is usually mid to late February.
04:46:37.263 Charles can sell the clovesfor their highest price
04:46:39.557 in the first 25 days ofthe harvesting season.
04:46:42.727 The more he can harvest during this time,
04:46:44.770 the better it is for business.
04:46:54.405 Narrator: During peak harvesting season,
04:46:56.157 these workers make around$30 a day on average.
04:47:01.162 Once the clove clusters are picked,
04:47:02.997 harvesters carefullyremove the individual buds
04:47:05.708 from the stalks and leaves.
04:47:08.419 They sift and sort eachbud according to its size,
04:47:11.214 age, and whether it has a top.
04:47:14.592 It's best if the circularcrown of the clove,
04:47:16.844 where it would otherwiseflower, is still intact.
04:47:19.972 This improves the spice's taste and aroma.
04:47:23.768 Even though there are machinesto help with this process,
04:47:26.479 Charles prefers to payfor it to be done by hand
04:47:29.065 to lower the risk of clove damage.
04:47:43.871 Narrator: The highest-quality cloves
04:47:45.039 were picked at the right time,
04:47:46.832 just before they turned pink or flowered.
04:47:49.210 They're large and plumpand still have the crown.
04:47:52.380 Second-quality cloves alsostill have their tops,
04:47:55.132 but they're smaller.
04:47:56.384 They were either pickedtoo early or too late.
04:47:59.345 And the third quality has no crown,
04:48:01.472 with the top having eitherflowered or broken off.
04:48:04.976 After the sorting, workersleave the cloves out
04:48:06.978 to dry in the sun.
04:48:08.354 High-quality cloves take three days to dry
04:48:10.523 under good sunlight.
04:48:12.525 But a quality clove won't always get sold
04:48:14.819 as the highest grade,because official grading
04:48:17.571 doesn't happen until after it's dry.
04:48:21.450 If there's too little or too much sun,
04:48:23.953 the clove's quality drops.
04:48:25.788 Instead of golden brown, it becomes black,
04:48:28.207 and it loses one of itsmost valuable properties,
04:48:30.751 its oil content.
04:48:33.713 First-quality cloves are the most fragrant
04:48:35.840 and have the highest oil content.
04:48:38.968 The headless third-qualitycloves have the least.
04:48:43.139 And the difference shows in the price.
04:48:45.433 Charles sells his first-quality cloves
04:48:47.184 for about $10 a kilogram
04:48:49.186 and his lowest grade for under $7.
04:48:53.190 Clove oil is mostly madeup of the compound eugenol,
04:48:56.527 which is not only responsible
04:48:57.778 for the clove's familiar aroma,
04:48:59.613 but also for its medicinal benefits.
04:49:02.366 Researchers have notedeugenol has antimicrobial,
04:49:05.369 anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving,
04:49:07.580 and antioxidant properties.
04:49:10.791 So the demand for cloves goesbeyond their culinary uses.
04:49:14.337 Cloves are so sought after in India
04:49:16.672 that Charles is able to sellmore than just the buds.
04:49:28.059 Narrator: That's alsobecause the cloves he grows,
04:49:30.519 Kanniyakumari cloves, are known for
04:49:32.730 their high oil content and strong aroma.
04:49:36.067 In fact, these cloves wereawarded a GI indication in 2021.
04:49:42.239 Charles says Kanniyakumari cloves
04:49:43.991 are the most expensive variety in India.
04:49:56.212 Narrator: The retailprice is so much higher
04:49:58.214 because of the supply chain.
04:50:00.674 To maximize on profits for the farm,
04:50:02.843 Charles won't sell hiscloves directly to consumers,
04:50:05.721 who only buy smaller amounts as needed.
04:50:08.224 Instead, he sells to clove dealers,
04:50:10.643 who buy large quantities.
04:50:13.020 Dealers like Franklin Roosevelt
04:50:14.563 then have to keep the cloves fresh
04:50:16.315 until they sell them to retailers.
04:50:18.943 If he doesn't store the cloves properly,
04:50:21.028 their shelf life drops.
04:50:36.377 Narrator: To cover thecost of quality control,
04:50:38.504 Franklin sells cloves tostores for almost $12 a kilo.
04:50:42.842 The shops that buy from Franklin
04:50:44.468 have to pay transportationand packaging costs,
04:50:47.471 bringing the retail price ofcloves in India even higher.
04:50:51.684 But one of the biggest challenges
04:50:53.144 in every step of the supply chain
04:50:55.062 has been the changing climate.
04:51:20.421 Narrator: Between 2018 and 2019,
04:51:22.673 India lost 13 metric tons ofcloves due to heavy rainfall.
04:51:27.553 And while the global clovemarket is expected to grow
04:51:30.222 by 3.5% by 2027,
04:51:32.933 the changing climate may still continue
04:51:34.768 to disproportionatelyburden clove farmers.
04:52:00.586 Narrator: On day one,
04:52:01.462 harvesters cut out these river reeds.
04:52:04.924 And in eight days, after drying,
04:52:08.427 burning,
04:52:09.678 and filtering,
04:52:10.971 the reeds will produce oneof the most expensive salts
04:52:13.807 in the world.
04:52:15.476 Just 1 tablespoon of river reed salt
04:52:17.728 costs about $1 in Kenya.
04:52:20.314 Compare that to the 4cents it costs locals
04:52:22.733 for the same amount of sea salt.
04:52:25.569 So how do producers makesalt from river reeds?
04:52:28.864 And why is it so expensive?
04:52:33.369 River reed salt, or chumvi ya kienyeji,
04:52:36.580 is made from the reeds of the muchua plant
04:52:38.832 that grow along the Nzoia River.
04:52:41.418 Once the salt is extracted,
04:52:43.212 it's typically sold in small quantities
04:52:45.256 to chefs and luxury-hotelowners in Kenya and abroad.
04:52:49.134 Buyers describe its saltinessas powerful and umami-like.
04:52:53.305 I buy the river reed salt because of,
04:52:56.308 I will say, the magic in it.
04:52:58.143 The texture is smooth.
04:52:59.979 It is not rough or coarse.
04:53:01.897 For those who havetasted umami from Japan,
04:53:05.568 it tastes almost the same,
04:53:07.695 but this one has more of a sharp taste.
04:53:10.781 So when you're cooking with it,
04:53:12.408 you won't use a lot of it.
04:53:15.661 Narrator: Today, only the Bukusu community
04:53:17.913 in the village of Webuyecontinues the traditional process
04:53:21.250 of making this rare salt by hand.
04:53:24.795 This is the Nzoia River,
04:53:26.922 and this is Andrew Wanyonyi Sikanga.
04:53:30.342 Andrew and his sons harvest the reeds
04:53:32.052 that grow along the riverbanks.
04:53:34.471 Before they go out to harvest,
04:53:36.056 Andrew starts the morning with a prayer.
04:53:43.439 They pray for protection from the dangers
04:53:45.190 they might encounter at the river,
04:53:47.109 like snakes and crocodiles.
04:53:50.738 To avoid coming into contact with them,
04:53:52.615 Andrew and his sons need to harvest early.
04:54:10.549 Narrator: Today, they'relooking for ripe river reeds.
04:54:39.286 Narrator: If the reed isn'tat least 2 meters tall
04:54:41.288 and the flowers at the toparen't wilted and nearly dried,
04:54:44.750 the concentration of salt will be too low.
04:54:48.212 Andrew hacks away at the ripe reeds,
04:54:50.214 being careful not to uproot the plant
04:54:52.257 or cut too close to the roots.
04:54:54.426 That way, the reeds canregrow more quickly,
04:54:56.970 and the roots can continueto spread onto other rocks.
04:55:01.141 Only reeds with a high salt content
04:55:03.018 make the effort worthit, because from them,
04:55:05.604 Andrew can make enough salt to sell.
04:55:33.882 Narrator: Though there was a mild injury,
04:55:35.467 today's harvest was a good one.
04:55:38.470 After a long day of navigating the waters
04:55:40.472 of the Nzoia River, Andrew and his sons
04:55:42.725 leave the riverbank with a lot of reeds.
04:56:08.333 Narrator: Those 20 tablespoonswill sell for about $20.
04:56:12.588 Now, they can begin the long,
04:56:14.089 manual process of extracting salt.
04:56:18.177 First, Andrew must dry the reeds.
04:56:22.139 Drying reeds can take fourdays when the skies are sunny,
04:56:25.267 but in cloudier weather,it'll take longer.
04:56:31.815 To begin processing, hehas to burn the reeds
04:56:34.151 for one to three days.
04:56:43.118 Once all the reeds turn to ash,
04:56:45.037 Andrew places them in a largepot with drainage holes.
04:56:54.463 Then he slowly adds water.
04:56:57.925 The water filters throughthe ashes and holes,
04:57:00.135 each drop collecting at the bottom.
04:57:04.556 He pours those dropletsthrough another filter
04:57:06.809 and into an aluminum pan.
04:57:10.896 Next, he places the pan over an open fire,
04:57:13.732 where the solution is left to boil
04:57:15.317 until the liquid evaporates.
04:57:20.906 Finally, after a full day of work,
04:57:23.242 Andrew is left with this wet, salty paste.
04:57:27.663 The next day, he packs thepaste into banana leaves
04:57:30.374 and places them under hot ashes to dry.
04:57:38.423 After three hours, the salt hardens.
04:57:42.636 From reed to salt, the processtakes at least eight days.
04:57:46.390 Andrew will sell the saltin the banana leaves.
04:57:50.352 This is the same long process
04:57:52.354 his family has practiced for generations.
04:58:08.620 Narrator: It's believedthe tradition began
04:58:10.038 in the 17th century
04:58:11.456 when the Bukusu peoplemigrated eastward from Congo.
04:58:15.168 At the time, areas in western Kenya
04:58:17.421 were cut off from salt routes.
04:58:20.048 So they set out to finda way to extract salt
04:58:22.342 from these aquatic plants.
04:58:26.263 Centuries later, the saltthat was made out of necessity
04:58:29.349 became a pricey commodity.
04:58:33.186 At the market, this pack containing
04:58:35.105 just 3 tablespoons of river reed salt
04:58:37.357 costs about $3, and this larger pack, $7.
04:58:42.738 It's likely to sell, becauselocal demand is high.
04:58:45.908 Buyers know the intense workput into making this salt,
04:58:48.535 so for them, the price is worth it.
04:58:52.080 Although there aren'tstudies to confirm it,
04:58:54.166 market sellers say thatpart of what keeps the salt
04:58:56.501 in high demand locally
04:58:57.836 is the belief it has specialmedicinal properties.
04:59:01.423 But the most notable feature is its taste.
04:59:05.218 In fact, Andrew's riverreed salt won the title
04:59:07.888 for most unique indigenous salt
04:59:09.806 at an international gastronomy exhibition
04:59:12.017 in Italy in 2014.
04:59:14.811 Slow Food, one of theorganizers of the exhibition,
04:59:17.689 established a presidium in 2009
04:59:19.858 for Kenya's river reed salt
04:59:21.401 to drive more demand for the product.
04:59:24.196 But fulfilling that demandwould require more supply,
04:59:27.157 which is difficult whenproduction is so limited.
04:59:30.911 One of the biggest threatsto river reed salt production
04:59:33.664 is climate change.
04:59:36.583 According to Slow Food, thegrowing population in Kenya
04:59:39.461 has led to deforestation.
04:59:42.255 Indigenous trees along the Nzoia River
04:59:44.466 have long held soil particlestogether and provided shade,
04:59:47.761 keeping temperatures stable.
04:59:50.347 But the loss of these trees,
04:59:51.682 along with higher temperatures,
04:59:53.183 unstable river levels, and landslides,
04:59:55.394 has contributed to theloss of river reeds.
04:59:58.897 Andrew tried growing thereeds with other water sources
05:00:01.900 but couldn't get the same outcome.
05:00:34.016 Narrator: In additionto conservation efforts
05:00:35.892 like replanting indigenous trees,
05:00:38.145 Slow Food is working oncreating more marshy areas
05:00:40.522 for the reeds to grow.
05:00:42.983 Samson: Since the river reed salt
05:00:44.901 really does well with thewaters from the river,
05:00:48.113 we were thinking thatif we try a little bit
05:00:51.283 to divert some of thiswater from the river
05:00:54.453 and have a marshy areaplus some of the rocks,
05:00:57.789 we can actually try to see
05:00:59.291 whether we can increasethe number of reeds,
05:01:02.002 because I know that as the people continue
05:01:04.796 knowing about this particular salt,
05:01:07.132 there will be high demand.
05:01:09.509 Narrator: This small blue gemstone
05:01:11.428 is one of the rarest in the world.
05:01:14.598 And because of the uniqueway it forms in the earth,
05:01:17.267 benitoite sparkles evenbrighter than diamonds,
05:01:20.187 making it incredibly expensive.
05:01:23.690 A single carat can cost over $12,000.
05:01:27.778 But you can only reallyfind this gem in one place.
05:01:33.366 So why is benitoite so hard to find?
05:01:36.286 And what makes it so expensive?
05:01:43.376 How is benitoite differentfrom other gemstones?
05:01:47.005 It has a brighter vitreous luster.
05:01:50.342 Narrator: That means it looks like glass,
05:01:52.052 but brighter, shinier.
05:01:54.221 It also has a high dispersion, or fire,
05:01:57.349 meaning it can sparklemore than other gemstones.
05:02:06.733 Dave: So, here we areon the top of the mine.
05:02:12.447 Narrator: This is a private mine.
05:02:14.116 It's part of Benitoite Mining Company,
05:02:16.326 owned by John and Dave Schreiner.
05:02:18.745 The company is stationed here
05:02:20.372 because facet-grade benitoite can be found
05:02:22.457 in only one location:
05:02:24.251 San Benito County, California.
05:02:26.628 That's why it's the state's gem.
05:02:29.089 There have been microscopicdeposits found in Japan.
05:02:34.803 But so far, this is the onlyplace where you can find it
05:02:37.514 where it's actually bigenough to hold in your hand
05:02:39.975 and to put in jewelry.
05:02:42.602 Narrator: Not knowing how rare it was,
05:02:44.104 miners used to extract benitoitejust like any other gem,
05:02:47.732 with explosions and blunt force.
05:02:51.111 And now the supply is finite.
05:02:54.281 Gemstones like benitoiteare generally scattered,
05:02:57.200 but sometimes there's a vein underground
05:02:59.870 where concentrated amountsof the gem collect.
05:03:03.915 Benitoite formed when an oceanic plate
05:03:06.042 and a crustal plate came together.
05:03:08.545 One plate slid under the other,
05:03:10.589 and water got trapped in the fault line.
05:03:13.216 Magma then intruded into the fault line
05:03:15.468 and mixed with the trapped water.
05:03:17.512 As cracks and veins formedin the surrounding rock,
05:03:20.140 the superheated mixture flowed into them.
05:03:24.060 Here, the rare elementbarium bound with titanium,
05:03:27.397 silica, and other elements.
05:03:29.524 Together, they formed benitoite.
05:03:33.445 But finding the gem is abit of a guessing game.
05:03:36.448 And if John and Dave guessincorrectly, the cost is high.
05:03:40.911 To help them find wherebenitoite might be,
05:03:43.330 they look for this.
05:03:45.248 The white part of the rock is natrolite,
05:03:47.125 and the dark part, blueschist.
05:03:49.419 These are two minerals that surround
05:03:51.004 and protect benitoite.
05:03:52.672 If they see the white,
05:03:53.840 it may mean they'vefound a benitoite vein.
05:03:57.135 And when the vein breaksout onto the surface,
05:03:59.554 it's referred to as an outcrop.
05:04:03.350 A big vein, or a big outcrop,of benitoite was right here
05:04:06.978 and had fallen against the mountain.
05:04:08.855 That was dug out, dynamited.
05:04:10.732 All the material off the top of it's gone.
05:04:12.817 That doesn't mean there's not stones here.
05:04:14.986 They're all over the place.
05:04:17.781 Narrator: Yet a benitoitevein hasn't been found here
05:04:20.033 since the late 1990s.
05:04:22.369 So today, John and Daveare mining in a location
05:04:25.080 they think has potential.
05:04:27.707 They have to narrow downwhere they think the vein is,
05:04:30.377 because excavating anddrilling is expensive,
05:04:33.129 and they can't afford to be wrong.
05:04:37.092 Core drilling alonewill cost them $200,000.
05:04:40.845 John: Funding is always an issue.
05:04:43.515 Mining is not a cheap venture.
05:04:45.600 Normally that's what's holding us back,
05:04:47.477 just having the funds toactually move forward.
05:04:51.106 Narrator: So as theywork up to that funding,
05:04:52.857 they're also working to confirmexactly where the vein is.
05:04:57.320 After they load all thematerial they excavated,
05:04:59.864 they can begin processing it
05:05:01.241 to see if there's aconcentration of benitoite.
05:05:04.577 That starts with sorting.
05:05:08.581 This is the first stage of the wash plant.
05:05:11.835 Right over here is where the material
05:05:13.586 gets dumped in originally.
05:05:16.339 So, everything above inch and a half
05:05:18.466 gets stopped right there.
05:05:20.510 Narrator: After this, John can locate
05:05:22.095 larger specimens thatneed to be acid-etched,
05:05:25.056 where acid is used to carefullybreak off the benitoite
05:05:27.642 from its surroundings.
05:05:29.269 They also screen for everythingunder an eighth-inch,
05:05:32.147 and the sorted materialgoes up a long conveyor belt
05:05:34.816 to be washed in the trommel.
05:05:37.193 The trommel shakes and cleans the rocks
05:05:39.070 before they hit the black-light room.
05:05:41.865 Benitoite is fluorescent, sothe Schreiners use UV light
05:05:44.826 to identify the gem without damaging it.
05:05:48.079 After, he screens and washesall the fluorescent pieces
05:05:51.458 and collects the best ones.
05:05:54.586 John: There's one of them.
05:05:59.632 That is a benitoite.
05:06:03.636 Narrator: Even though Johnfound some good pieces
05:06:05.430 of benitoite, today'sexcavation was just OK.
05:06:10.894 John: This is good. We've done better.
05:06:14.647 Narrator: Still, he andDave remain hopeful.
05:06:17.400 They're confident thatthey're getting really close
05:06:19.444 to locating that vein.
05:06:22.155 Finding another benitoitevein would be outstanding.
05:06:25.367 It would change a lot of things.
05:06:28.244 That is the direction we're going in
05:06:30.413 and that we want to go in.
05:06:31.790 It's financially hindering,
05:06:35.585 but we are getting there.
05:06:39.005 Narrator: But even ifJohn and Dave find a vein,
05:06:41.216 it doesn't mean all thebenitoite they excavate
05:06:43.635 can be sold for top dollar.
05:06:46.554 Benitoite is a naturallysmall gem, like diamonds,
05:06:50.016 so most of the rocks theyfind can't be faceted
05:06:52.519 into a clean, clear gem.
05:06:54.646 John: On average, you lose about
05:06:55.772 80% of the stone duringthe cutting process.
05:06:57.440 It also depends on how cleanyou want the stone to be.
05:07:00.110 Narrator: But the remarkable
05:07:01.319 and highly valuableproperties of benitoite
05:07:03.780 make all this work worth it.
05:07:07.867 Starla: What's also veryunique about benitoite
05:07:12.163 is that it is doubly refractive.
05:07:15.458 So when the light enters thestone, it splits into two rays.
05:07:19.629 Narrator: This creates a doubling effect,
05:07:21.548 giving benitoite a complexinternal appearance.
05:07:24.843 Yet on the surface,
05:07:26.052 it looks like light bouncesoff the gem on all sides.
05:07:29.973 The depth these qualitiescreate is enriched
05:07:32.350 by the stone's color,which shows in the price.
05:07:35.937 Starla: In a color gemstone is color.
05:07:38.398 Color, color, color is the first and last
05:07:41.192 and most important factor affecting value
05:07:43.736 in a color gemstone.
05:07:45.447 And depth also holds the color.
05:07:48.366 Like, a deeper stonecan have a deeper color,
05:07:50.743 and that makes it more valuable.
05:07:52.495 The darker the color, the more valuable
05:07:54.205 the stone typically is.
05:07:58.626 For thousands of years,
05:08:00.086 agarwood has been knownas "The Wood of the Gods."
05:08:03.798 First-grade agarwood
05:08:04.841 can cost as much as $100,000 per kilogram,
05:08:08.344 making it one of the mostexpensive raw materials
05:08:10.513 in the world.
05:08:12.223 But for this tree to produce any agarwood,
05:08:15.393 it must first become infected with mold.
05:08:19.022 So, how does this infection process work?
05:08:22.192 What is agarwood used for?
05:08:24.277 And what makes it so valuable?
05:08:29.949 Aquilaria malaccensis
05:08:31.493 is a tree native to therainforests of southeast Asia.
05:08:35.747 Prior to infection,
05:08:36.831 the healthy heartwoodinside Aquilaria trees
05:08:39.167 is pale, odorless, and worthless.
05:08:42.253 However, in the wild,
05:08:43.796 damage to the tree by external forces,
05:08:46.049 such as grazing animals,
05:08:47.759 sporadically results in the growth
05:08:49.427 of a specific type of fungalinfection inside the tree
05:08:53.056 called Phialophora parasitica.
05:08:55.892 The Aquilaria's defense to this attack
05:08:57.894 is to produce a stress-inducedaromatic resin called aloes,
05:09:02.065 which is dark and moist.
05:09:04.526 Over the course of several years,
05:09:05.944 the aloes slowly embed into the heartwood
05:09:08.446 to create agarwood.
05:09:42.814 Narrator: Once agarwood is harvested,
05:09:44.274 it needs to be separated
05:09:45.400 from the healthy Aquilaria wood around it.
05:09:48.194 In a painstaking taskthat often takes hours,
05:09:51.197 resin-infused chips, also known as oud,
05:09:53.825 are carved out by hand.
05:09:57.328 Oud chips are commonly used as incense,
05:09:59.664 particularly in the Middle East,
05:10:01.291 where they're burnt bothas tokens of hospitality
05:10:03.876 and infused into clothesand garments as a perfume.
05:10:27.775 Narrator: Oud is also distilledinto an essential oil.
05:10:30.570 And in its purest form,
05:10:32.071 aged oud oil can costup to $80,000 per liter,
05:10:35.533 earning the nickname amongsttraders of "liquid gold."
05:10:38.870 As its popularity continuesto grow in the West,
05:10:41.789 oud has become a common ingredient
05:10:43.291 in several high-value fragrances,
05:10:45.501 adding a warm, musky aroma.
05:10:48.755 But due to unsustainableproduction and poaching,
05:10:51.299 all varieties of Aquilaria trees
05:10:53.259 are now classified ascritically endangered,
05:10:55.928 with experts estimatingthe global population
05:10:58.431 has declined by 80%over the last 150 years.
05:11:02.810 Even for those surviving Aquilaria trees,
05:11:05.271 the frequency of natural fungalinfection is extremely low.
05:11:09.400 Some estimates say only2% of wild Aquilaria trees
05:11:12.695 are adequately infected toproduce agarwood naturally,
05:11:16.199 meaning the hunt to find natural agarwood
05:11:18.159 is extremely arduous.
05:11:55.029 Narrator: With natural agarwoodnow bordering on extinction,
05:11:57.740 in some forestries,
05:11:59.158 like this one managedby Truong in Vietnam,
05:12:02.203 trees are artificially inoculated
05:12:04.372 with a microbial compound
05:12:06.082 to induce the all-important resin.
05:12:42.785 Narrator: Agarwood wasdescribed as a fragrant product
05:12:44.996 of wealth and luxury
05:12:46.330 in one of the world'soldest written texts,
05:12:48.833 the Sanskrit Vedas,
05:12:50.376 dating back as early as 1,400 BC.
05:12:54.130 The aroma produced fromagarwood has been highly valued
05:12:56.966 by many cultures andreligions throughout history.
05:13:00.511 In the Nirvana Sutra, aloes is mentioned
05:13:02.680 as a "heavenly wood" usedin the cremation of Buddha.
05:13:06.726 In the New Testament,
05:13:07.810 Jesus' body was anointed witha mixture of myrrh and aloes
05:13:11.022 following his crucifixion.
05:13:14.025 And in the Sahih al-Bukhari Hadith,
05:13:16.194 the description of Paradiseby Allah's messenger
05:13:18.821 includes the burningof agarwood as incense.
05:13:22.533 The global market for agarwood
05:13:24.076 is estimated to be wortha staggering $32 billion.
05:13:28.414 But where oud was once so common,
05:13:30.416 high demand has not onlyincreased the price,
05:13:32.960 but also the rate of harvestingand artificial production.
05:13:36.631 By the end of 2029,
05:13:38.341 the market is expectedto double to $64 billion.
05:14:18.130 [gong sounds]
05:14:20.174 The unmistakable sound of the gong
05:14:22.218 has held spiritual significance
05:14:23.886 in Southeast Asia for centuries.
05:14:27.557 Hand beaten from sheet materials,
05:14:29.559 the labor-intensive shapingand delicate paintwork
05:14:32.687 result in beautifulpercussive instruments.
05:14:36.232 Souvenir gongs can be boughtfor just a few dollars,
05:14:39.151 but large, finely tuned gongsmade from the best materials
05:14:42.738 can fetch tens of thousands of dollars.
05:14:45.449 So, what are gongs actually used for?
05:14:47.493 And why are they so expensive?
05:14:52.582 This is Thailand's "gong highway,"
05:14:54.792 a 21-mile stretch of road that is home
05:14:57.253 to more than 50family-owned gong companies,
05:14:59.922 who collectively produceroughly 7,000 gongs each year.
05:15:04.635 [gong sounds]
05:15:05.928 In the heart of the gong highway
05:15:07.597 is Bunrak Seechana's workshop.
05:15:10.349 As a third-generation gong maker,
05:15:12.268 Bunrak has been studying
05:15:13.561 and practicing gong makingfor almost 50 years.
05:15:46.052 Narrator: The process begins by cutting
05:15:47.470 the sheet material into a circle.
05:15:49.805 No materials go to waste here.
05:15:51.682 Even the offcuts are used
05:15:53.059 to make the largest shape possible.
05:15:56.228 It's at this early stage
05:15:57.730 where the eventual cost ofeach gong is determined.
05:16:23.422 Narrator: Once the edgeshave been smoothed,
05:16:25.383 a welder attaches the sides.
05:16:29.220 This flat dish is then readyto be hammered into shape.
05:16:32.890 The gongs made here in Thailandare of the bossed variety,
05:16:36.060 where a center knob issurrounded by smaller nipples.
05:16:40.106 This design is stenciledon the back of the gong
05:16:42.483 with a homemade compass,
05:16:44.193 and bangers begin to hammer out the shape.
05:16:49.156 The bangers use templatesengraved into tree stumps
05:16:52.118 that allow the knob and nipples
05:16:53.619 to be hammered out fully and evenly.
05:17:04.255 Then comes the hardest part, the tuning.
05:17:07.800 [gong sounds]
05:17:11.971 Tuners observe and train foryears to master their skill.
05:17:15.683 He strikes the gong in different places
05:17:17.810 and listens for acoustic imperfections.
05:17:19.895 [gong sounds]
05:17:25.651 Using a mallet to make slight alterations,
05:17:28.154 he continues this process,hoping to reduce dissonance
05:17:31.032 in the sound frequenciesemitted from the gong.
05:18:02.188 Narrator: Once satisfied with the sound,
05:18:03.898 the gong is coated in enamel,
05:18:05.399 ready for intricateartworks to be hand painted.
05:18:09.361 Bunrak's workshop produces gongs
05:18:11.030 of all different shapes and designs,
05:18:13.407 including specially made gongs,
05:18:14.825 which can sell for up to 1 million baht,
05:18:17.119 or around $33,000.
05:18:45.606 Narrator: The culturalsignificance of gongs
05:18:47.358 is clear to see in Ubon Ratchathani,
05:18:49.902 a major city at one endof the gong highway,
05:18:52.446 where the world's largest gong towers
05:18:54.156 stand proudly next to theWat Tham Khuha Sawan temple.
05:18:57.993 The use of gongs is deeplyingrained in Buddhism,
05:19:00.788 and according to the TourismAuthority of Thailand,
05:19:03.290 the gong highway isresponsible for supplying
05:19:05.584 most of the country's30,000 Buddhist temples
05:19:08.587 with their gongs.
05:19:10.798 So, what about the rest of the world?
05:19:13.551 In the West, gongs have become commonplace
05:19:15.636 not only in popular culture,
05:19:17.638 but also in meditation studiosand symphony orchestras.
05:19:21.559 The largest non-Asian gong manufacturer
05:19:23.644 is Paiste, based in Germany.
05:19:26.147 It's been producing gongs since 1906,
05:19:28.941 and its largest gong, an80-inch symphonic model,
05:19:32.319 retails for around $27,000.
05:19:36.157 [gong sounds]
05:19:45.124 This type of flat-face gong,
05:19:46.709 sometimes referred to as a tam-tam,
05:19:48.711 gives more of a "crash" sound,
05:19:50.462 which is different from thetuned tones of a bossed gong.
05:19:54.133 [gong sounds]
05:20:08.606 Paiste's methods for producing gongs
05:20:10.399 are more scientific thanthose on the gong highway,
05:20:13.360 with acoustic testing equipment
05:20:14.987 used to evaluate the gong's frequency.
05:20:19.533 But the quality andtraditional craftsmanship
05:20:21.619 at Bunrak's workshop is clear to see,
05:20:24.413 and the historical importance of the gong
05:20:26.207 is felt throughout Southeast Asia.
05:21:10.709 This is a Đông Tảo chicken,
05:21:13.170 often known as dragon chickens.
05:21:14.880 These thick-legged birdscan sell for over $2,000.
05:21:20.302 Each one can take years ofraising and special care,
05:21:23.514 and the best are even entered
05:21:24.682 into beauty competitions across Vietnam.
05:21:28.352 So, what does it take toraise a Đông Tảo chicken,
05:21:30.938 and why are they so expensive?
05:21:40.906 Đông Tảo is a rare breed,
05:21:42.574 exclusive to one small villageon the outskirts of Hanoi.
05:21:46.954 Giang Tuấn Vũ is a third-generationĐông Tảo chicken farmer.
05:21:50.624 He's been looking after thesebirds for over 20 years.
05:22:36.837 Narrator: The majority of these chickens
05:22:38.172 are still raised in Đông Tảo Village.
05:22:40.966 While the exact originsof the breed are unknown,
05:22:43.218 they've been around for hundreds of years
05:22:45.346 and were thought to be bred originally
05:22:46.722 for cockfighting due totheir thick and strong legs.
05:22:50.476 These days, the birds area more decorative breed
05:22:52.978 that's often eaten for its unique meat.
05:23:14.083 Narrator: The dramaticlook of Đông Tảo chickens
05:23:16.126 means that they've beenimportant gifts for years.
05:23:18.587 Originally presented to royalty,
05:23:20.297 they're now reservedfor special occasions,
05:23:22.091 such as Tết, Vietnamese New Year.
05:24:14.143 Narrator: That meansthat from the 500 chicks,
05:24:16.520 just 15 could qualify to be sold as gifts.
05:24:19.606 So, what are the criteria thatthese chickens need to meet
05:24:22.192 to be worth thousands of dollars?
05:25:10.616 Narrator: When preparingthe chickens for sale
05:25:12.242 or competition, a lot of work
05:25:13.869 goes in to looking after them.
05:25:15.871 And roughly a month before,
05:25:17.206 they're fed a special high-protein diet,
05:25:19.291 and their legs are washed gently
05:25:20.751 in a mixture of tea and salt.
05:25:23.462 Physical appearance isn'tall about the feet, either.
05:25:26.548 Every part of their lookis equally important
05:25:28.634 when it comes to grading,
05:25:29.968 from symmetrical wattles and earlobes
05:25:32.054 to uniformly covered shiny black feathers.
05:25:52.366 Narrator: While many of the birds
05:25:53.242 are sold off around theholidays for their meat,
05:25:55.369 the really high-valuechickens are often kept
05:25:57.412 by the farmers and enteredinto beauty contests.
05:26:00.207 The longer the chickens live,the larger their features,
05:26:02.918 and so grade A Đông Tảo chicken
05:26:05.045 could live for six or seven years.
05:26:32.364 Narrator: While the chicken's popularity
05:26:33.532 is mostly still contained to Vietnam,
05:26:35.617 interest around the world is growing,
05:26:37.619 and in April 2018, 802Đông Tảo chicken eggs
05:26:41.290 were seized by police atAtaturk Airport in Istanbul
05:26:44.376 after they were found being smuggled
05:26:45.752 into the country in acustom-made suitcase.
05:26:49.006 These eggs were valuedby police at $2,000 each
05:26:52.259 and show that no matter theprice these chickens reach,
05:26:54.553 there will always be those willing to pay.
05:27:02.311 Coconuts have been cultivated
05:27:03.895 in tropical climatesfor thousands of years,
05:27:06.982 and they produce some of themost expensive cooking oil,
05:27:10.277 coconut oil can sellfor around 12 times the
05:27:11.111 price of canola oil whenyou compare leading brands.
05:27:14.281 The industry is predicted to grow
05:27:16.450 by half a billion dollars worldwide
05:27:18.785 over the next four years.
05:27:21.038 But with the hotlycontested health benefits
05:27:23.123 some coconut-oil companies promote,
05:27:25.459 should it be as expensive as it is?
05:27:28.128 So what's the truth behind coconut oil,
05:27:30.672 and why is it so expensive?
05:27:41.016 Its supposedly versatility
05:27:42.601 is the reason for its high price.
05:27:45.145 While coconut has a longtradition of use in food
05:27:47.814 and medicine across Asia,
05:27:49.733 its oil is the most valuable byproduct.
05:27:53.612 Here in the Philippines, where over 44%
05:27:55.989 of the world's coconut oil is produced,
05:27:58.283 coconut trees thrive in a long dry season.
05:28:02.037 But even with a bounty ofcoconuts at your fingertips --
05:28:04.623 assuming you can climb high enough --
05:28:06.792 the process of extractingthe oil isn't easy.
05:28:10.087 [cow mooing]
05:28:13.965 Each coconut has a layer ofhusk surrounding its shell
05:28:16.635 that must be removed by hand.
05:28:18.720 Only then can it be cleaved in half
05:28:20.597 with a special tool called a bolo knife.
05:28:43.245 Narrator: In the Philippines,
05:28:44.121 14.8 million metric tons of coconuts
05:28:46.998 were harvested in 2019 alone,
05:28:50.085 and these were used to make
05:28:51.086 around 1.6 million metric tons of oil --
05:28:54.464 much of it exported to the US or Europe.
05:29:00.512 And by the time the coconutoil reaches the Western market,
05:29:03.640 the price for the productwill have roughly doubled.
05:29:08.311 Even with the ideal growingconditions for the trees,
05:29:11.106 coconut oil has grown so popular
05:29:13.191 that farmers in the Philippines
05:29:14.735 struggle to meet the demand.
05:29:18.655 In recent years, themarket for coconut oil
05:29:20.782 has surged in the Westalongside a cultural shift
05:29:23.827 towards the search fornatural, unprocessed products.
05:29:28.582 And coconut-oil manufacturers
05:29:30.250 were quick to capitalize on the sensation.
05:29:34.337 Consumption peaked in the US in 2009
05:29:37.007 at 598,000 metric tons,
05:29:40.260 and coconut oil quickly became
05:29:41.970 the mascot for a healthy lifestyle
05:29:44.306 as celebrities and bloggersadopted the product.
05:29:47.768 Proponents of coconutoil as a cure-all remedy
05:29:50.312 say that it can promote weight loss,
05:29:52.314 improve blood sugar,
05:29:53.565 and even slow theprogression of Alzheimer's
05:29:55.650 because of its highlevels of antioxidants.
05:29:58.945 But so far, all scientific studies
05:30:00.822 on the health benefits of coconut oil
05:30:02.866 have been inconclusive,
05:30:04.534 and nutritionists remain skeptical.
05:30:06.995 Some nutritionists say coconut oil
05:30:08.789 could actually do more harm than good.
05:30:11.583 Coconut oil is composed of
05:30:13.043 80% to 90% saturated fatty acid.
05:30:16.630 In 2017, the American Heart Association
05:30:19.216 issued an advisory against saturated fats
05:30:21.676 and specifically warned that coconut oil
05:30:23.929 increases cholesteroland should be avoided.
05:30:27.516 And soon after, the wholesale price
05:30:29.434 of coconut oil dropped by more than half.
05:30:32.729 But it's a dip that hasn't lasted,
05:30:34.773 and coconut oil's price isonce again rising rapidly.
05:30:38.985 The oil has become a keyingredient in many products,
05:30:42.322 perhaps most recently alternative meats.
05:30:45.450 Both Beyond and Impossible burgers
05:30:47.577 are reliant on coconut oil,
05:30:49.788 and their surging popularityhas increased demand.
05:30:53.542 But while coconut oil's popularity
05:30:55.210 shows no sign of slowing,
05:30:57.170 there's a looming problemfor the coconut supply.
05:31:00.257 Some estimates say as many as 90%
05:31:02.509 of all coconut trees in Asia
05:31:04.553 are nearing the end oftheir productive cycle.
05:31:07.556 The majority of coconut plantations
05:31:09.057 across the Philippines wereplanted 40 or 50 years ago,
05:31:12.894 and many of the trees are now producing
05:31:14.729 as little as 10 coconuts a year,
05:31:16.857 rather than the 100 to150 a healthy tree might.
05:31:45.385 Narrator: And the 10 liters that come from
05:31:46.928 all of these coconuts
05:31:48.138 would only fill up about 21 16-ounce jars
05:31:51.182 of coconut oil that you'dlikely find at a supermarket.
05:31:54.436 Given it takes about 10 years
05:31:55.937 for a new coconut tree to fruit,
05:31:57.606 planting new trees is going to be crucial
05:31:59.774 to keep up with this soaring demand.
05:32:03.695 But despite these problems,
05:32:05.113 the market is poised to grow
05:32:06.323 by $518 million before 2024.
05:32:15.707 Sơn mài is a traditional Vietnamese form
05:32:18.084 of lacquer painting
05:32:19.878 created using a toxic lacquer
05:32:21.671 harvested from one region of the country.
05:32:25.884 It requires months of application
05:32:28.219 and sanding back layers ofpaint to build up the image.
05:32:31.389 Last year, a sơn màipainting sold at auction
05:32:34.434 for $972,000.
05:32:37.354 So, what makes these paintings so special?
05:32:39.689 And why are they so expensive?
05:33:09.511 Narrator: Phạm Chính Trunghas dedicated almost 50 years
05:33:12.180 to mastering sơn mài andknows how equally tiring
05:33:15.475 and rewarding the craft can be.
05:33:17.978 It is an art form of incrediblevalue in Vietnamese culture,
05:33:21.439 for both the time and skill it requires
05:33:23.942 and the exclusive naturalmaterials needed to make it.
05:33:27.654 The process of making lacquer paint
05:33:29.239 begins in the forests of Vietnam,
05:33:32.325 where planters collectresin from a toxic wax tree
05:33:35.245 native to Southeast Asiacalled the Rhus succedanea.
05:33:46.673 Planters must cut into more than 400 trees
05:33:48.883 to retrieve between 1 and1.5 kilograms of resin.
05:34:16.786 Narrator: After harvesting,the lacquer must be removed
05:34:18.997 of any impurities andmixed for several hours
05:34:22.083 before it's suitable for painting.
05:34:24.544 One of the principle features of sơn mài
05:34:26.296 is the depth created byadding several layers of paint
05:34:29.174 and sanding them back.
05:34:31.760 These layers aren't alwaysvisible in the finished work
05:34:34.262 but are what differentiatelacquer painting
05:34:36.264 from other common painting styles.
05:34:38.850 With oil painting, artistspaint from back to front,
05:34:41.644 painting the landscapefirst and the details later.
05:34:44.773 The process of lacquerpainting is the opposite.
05:35:25.772 Narrator: Artists mix naturalingredients to create colors,
05:35:28.733 like eggshells to make white
05:35:30.819 or cinnabar, a toxic ore, for red.
05:35:34.197 In some cases, artistsadd leaves of silver,
05:35:36.449 sometimes even gold, tocreate a gentle sheen.
05:35:40.370 These substances can be one of
05:35:41.621 the costliest parts of sơn mài painting.
05:36:01.349 Narrator: While the rawmaterials of the painting
05:36:02.976 may be more expensivethan many other styles,
05:36:05.478 the skill and the work of the artist
05:36:07.397 are what set the final value.
05:36:10.066 Along with the immensepatience sơn mài requires,
05:36:12.610 each work is unique and unpredictable.
05:36:15.488 That's because paintersare never quite sure
05:36:17.907 how the layers willresurface through sanding.
05:36:20.952 This can either increasethe value of the work
05:36:23.413 or force an artist to start over.
05:37:01.117 Narrator: Painters must be careful
05:37:02.202 to let each layer fullydry before sanding.
05:37:04.829 Otherwise, colors ordesigns could be ruined.
05:37:08.416 There's no set amount oftime a layer takes to dry,
05:37:11.544 as it largely dependson the weather that day.
05:37:57.006 Narrator: After weeks of work,
05:37:58.549 pieces are polished with coal powder,
05:38:00.510 which creates the smooth surface
05:38:02.053 and lasting shine of sơn mài.
05:38:04.973 Artists have used lacquerfor its glossy finish
05:38:07.850 for thousands of years.
05:38:10.061 One of its best-known applications
05:38:11.688 is Japanese lacquerware --
05:38:13.523 decorative pieces of furniture,boxes, and dinnerware.
05:38:16.734 But in the early 20thcentury, Vietnamese artists
05:38:19.320 developed an interest in lacquer painting
05:38:21.739 and created a style unique to the world.
05:38:25.076 Impressive as these works can be,
05:38:26.953 the process is both costly and arduous.
05:38:30.623 And that's why Phạm Chính Trung believes
05:38:32.292 the future of thistradition will depend on
05:38:34.794 finding more artists willing to learn it.
05:39:02.113 Stone crab claws are oneof the priciest seafoods
05:39:04.574 you can buy.
05:39:06.034 And depending on their size,
05:39:07.368 a pound of claws at a restaurant
05:39:09.287 can cost as much as $70.
05:39:11.998 But catching these crabs is hard work.
05:39:14.667 Strangely enough,
05:39:15.543 fishers can only harvestthe claws from the crabs,
05:39:18.504 while the bodies must bereturned to the ocean.
05:39:21.382 So, what makes these claws so coveted?
05:39:24.260 And why are they so expensive?
05:39:28.473 You can only fish for stone crab
05:39:29.974 on the southeastern coast of the US,
05:39:32.060 Cuba, the Bahamas, and Mexico.
05:39:34.562 And it's Florida wheremore stone crabs are caught
05:39:36.939 than anywhere else.
05:39:38.983 These crustaceans aremarkedly more expensive
05:39:41.361 than other popular crabs.
05:39:43.696 A pound of claws cancost two times the price
05:39:46.074 of Alaskan snow crab legs.
05:39:48.326 Part of what makes these crabs so costly
05:39:50.495 is the labor-intensiveprocess of catching them.
05:39:53.664 Ernie Piton: There's a nice crab.
05:39:55.792 Narrator: Ernie Piton Jr.has been commercially fishing
05:39:58.169 for stone crabs for over 40 years.
05:40:01.631 With limited time to harvest each year,
05:40:03.424 his crew must start their days early,
05:40:05.843 sailing out before the sun rises.
05:40:11.849 The process begins with dropping traps
05:40:13.643 down to the ocean floor.
05:40:17.188 Kevin Henry: This is probablythe funnest part, you know?
05:40:19.315 You get to be a little more physical,
05:40:22.110 you know what I mean?
05:40:22.944 It's a little bit of arhythm thing going on here.
05:40:25.071 It's like dancing mariachi.
05:40:29.409 Narrator: But plucking these claws
05:40:30.493 can be a dangerous process.
05:40:32.578 Bill Kelly: The claws on an adult crab
05:40:34.705 can have as much as9,000 pounds of pressure
05:40:37.542 per square inch.
05:40:38.960 With the enormous pressure that's exerted,
05:40:40.920 they could actually pop afinger off at the joint.
05:40:44.340 Kevin: These crabs, theyhave a mind of their own.
05:40:46.092 You can easily get bit,
05:40:48.845 you know, if you're not careful.
05:40:50.263 I've only been bit maybe, say,
05:40:51.806 eight times in my career.
05:40:53.724 Popped over a million claws in my day.
05:40:57.311 Narrator: The crew leavesthe traps in the water
05:40:58.813 for about two weeks
05:40:59.856 before they're pulled in by a rope.
05:41:03.734 Then each one must be sorted thoroughly.
05:41:06.112 Kevin: We come back in a couple weeks,
05:41:07.655 and then got a couple in the trap,
05:41:09.657 we're gonna pull them out.
05:41:11.117 We're gonna pop their clawsand hope for a good day.
05:41:15.288 Narrator: Crews breakoff the claws quickly,
05:41:16.789 so they don't keep the crabsout of water for too long.
05:41:19.959 But even if a trap is full of crabs,
05:41:22.253 Kevin can't necessarily take every claw.
05:41:25.214 The state requires all harvested claws
05:41:27.216 to be at least 2 7/8 inches long.
05:41:30.678 Crabbers can legally break off both claws
05:41:32.847 if they meet the required size.
05:41:35.099 Ernie: The ones that look smaller,
05:41:36.100 we measure them on the gauge.
05:41:38.394 Like that one.
05:41:40.146 Narrator: Crabs are one of few animals
05:41:41.355 that can regenerate.
05:41:42.523 When a crab loses a claw -- or two --
05:41:44.817 it can grow each one back in time.
05:41:46.986 On average, claws cantake up to three years
05:41:49.322 to grow large enough to harvest again,
05:41:51.699 which is why the state requires
05:41:53.034 that crabbers pay closeattention to each claw's size.
05:41:56.704 This ensures fishers don'tremove one prematurely.
05:42:00.082 But despite the claws' ability to regrow,
05:42:02.126 some researchers have questioned
05:42:03.377 the sustainability of this system.
05:42:05.630 The Florida Fish and WildlifeConservation Commission
05:42:08.090 found that 46% to 82% of crabs died
05:42:10.968 from the loss of two claws,
05:42:12.720 while 23% to 59% diedfrom the removal of one.
05:42:16.349 That's compared to just 12.8% of crabs
05:42:18.726 that died when no claws were removed.
05:42:21.437 Crabs can also only regrow a claw
05:42:23.397 if the joint that linkedit is left intact.
05:42:25.775 Otherwise, it'll bleed to death.
05:42:27.985 This makes the way these claws are broken
05:42:29.612 all the more important forpreserving the fishery's future.
05:42:34.909 Hiring enough people to makethe operation run smoothly
05:42:37.453 is another reason for thehigh price of these claws.
05:42:40.790 And then there's one othercost you'd never expect.
05:42:44.544 Each trip requires 900 poundsof pig's feet for bait.
05:42:48.714 And that's just about half
05:42:49.882 of the total cost of fishing for the day.
05:42:53.302 Ernie: Normal running costto go stone crabbing today
05:42:55.263 is about $1,100 to leave the dock.
05:42:58.224 Bait prices have gone up,
05:42:59.433 fuel prices have gone up.
05:43:01.602 You know, the track tagprices have gone up.
05:43:07.149 Narrator: After 10 hours on the boat,
05:43:08.442 Ernie's crew must boil and ice their catch
05:43:10.486 as soon as they return,
05:43:12.363 otherwise the claws won't stay fresh.
05:43:16.909 They finish the day by weighing each claw,
05:43:18.911 which ultimately sets the final value.
05:43:22.164 Claws are sold in four sizes.
05:43:24.417 At Billy's Stone Crab,
05:43:25.418 restaurant prices rangefrom $35 to $70 per pound.
05:43:29.422 Brian Hershey: We run about 4,000 pounds
05:43:30.881 of stone crab throughthe restaurant each week.
05:43:33.509 On a busy weekend,
05:43:34.719 we sell 700 to 800 pounds of stone crab.
05:43:37.888 Narrator: The mostexpensive order costs $140.
05:43:40.975 The plate is made up offour 7-ounce colossal claws,
05:43:44.186 which yields just under1 pound of crabmeat.
05:43:47.356 Fresh-cooked claws soldon ice are less expensive,
05:43:50.234 but even then, the mediums will cost you
05:43:52.111 $29 per pound.
05:43:56.365 Years ago, stone crabsweren't such valuable food.
05:43:59.493 In the 1890s, they werenothing more than bycatch
05:44:02.038 in spiny-lobster traps.
05:44:03.998 Fishers began to keep the crabsthat fell into those traps,
05:44:07.043 and by the late 20th century,
05:44:08.586 the stone crab fishery had become
05:44:10.046 one of the most valuableindustries in Florida.
05:44:13.341 Today, it's worth $30 million,
05:44:15.760 and the prices of these claws
05:44:17.053 aren't likely to drop anytime soon.
05:44:19.930 Data from the FWC show thenumber of crabs caught each year
05:44:23.225 has declined by 712,000 pounds.
05:44:26.395 That's since peak harvestin the late 1990s.
05:44:29.315 Many commercial harvesters
05:44:30.483 have also startedfishing farther offshore,
05:44:32.985 pointing to a lesser numberof crabs in the area.
05:44:35.988 The FWC says both of these changes
05:44:38.074 signify a threat of overfishing,
05:44:40.451 and prices have gone up
05:44:41.452 in order to keep the fishery profitable.
05:44:43.996 To further protect the species' future,
05:44:45.998 the FWC instated even stricterregulations last year.
05:44:49.877 Two changes include an increase
05:44:51.754 in the minimum size of harvestable claws
05:44:54.382 and cutting the fishingseason short by two weeks.
05:44:57.677 These limitations aren't likely
05:44:59.178 to lower the cost of stone crab claws.
05:45:01.389 But the goal is to help preserve them
05:45:03.099 and keep Florida fishersbusy for years to come.
05:45:07.561 Ceylon cinnamon is native
05:45:08.979 to just one region of the world,
05:45:11.273 and producing it requireshours of delicate work.
05:45:16.153 Even the most skilledworkers can make only
05:45:18.447 a few pounds of quills a day.
05:45:21.450 One pound of cinnamon quills can cost $27,
05:45:24.995 but not all spices labeledcinnamon are the Ceylon variety.
05:45:28.874 Many in the Western market are actually
05:45:30.626 cheaper types of cinnamon called cassia.
05:45:33.713 So what makes Ceyloncinnamon so favorable?
05:45:36.424 And why is it so expensive?
05:45:47.101 Ceylon cinnamon is namedafter the old British name
05:45:49.729 for Sri Lanka, and it is oftenconsidered "real" cinnamon.
05:45:54.275 It is made from the dried inner bark
05:45:55.818 of a tree called Cinnamomum verum.
05:46:00.656 Growing these trees is an investment.
05:46:03.033 Farmers must wait four yearsafter a tree is planted
05:46:05.870 before they can begin harvesting.
05:46:09.874 At harvest, workersbreak down the branches
05:46:11.876 early in the morning, whenthe bark is still moist.
05:46:33.272 Ruwanpura must continuously care
05:46:35.024 for the trees throughout the year,
05:46:37.026 otherwise the branches won't be suitable
05:46:38.819 for making cinnamon at all.
05:47:04.929 The rigorous nature of thisjob has only just begun.
05:47:10.226 Now peelers must do thedelicate and essential work
05:47:13.187 of stripping the inner barkof each branch by hand.
05:47:35.709 This is the most labor-intensivepart of the process,
05:47:38.712 and it's not as easy assimply shaving the outside
05:47:41.173 of the bark as you wouldthe skin from a potato.
05:47:44.218 To produce the most valuable cinnamon,
05:47:46.053 the bark must be made extremely thin.
05:47:48.514 The thinner the quills are,the more costly they will be.
05:47:51.892 Ruwanpura has spent 40years mastering this skill.
05:47:57.147 Soon after the bark is removed,
05:47:58.899 each piece dries under the sun
05:48:00.568 and curls up within a few minutes.
05:48:03.070 After drying, the small pieces are stuffed
05:48:05.197 inside a straight piece of bark,
05:48:07.241 forming one 42-inch quill.
05:48:12.121 By the end of a long day,workers will have only produced
05:48:14.999 about 3 pounds of quills.
05:48:17.126 Those then need to dryfor three to four days
05:48:19.628 before they're packed into bales
05:48:21.213 and sent off to a separate facility.
05:48:23.549 That's where there'll begraded and officially priced
05:48:25.968 based on their width.
05:48:28.095 PDRomanis and Sons buys bales of cinnamon
05:48:30.514 from various peelers.
05:48:32.141 At its facility, quillsare graded over 10 scales.
05:48:35.394 The most valuable quillsare classified as Alba.
05:48:38.564 It takes a peeler four times longer
05:48:40.274 to produce one kilogram of Alba
05:48:42.484 than to produce the samequantity of lower grades.
05:48:58.876 The leftover, smaller cuts areturned into ground cinnamon
05:49:02.087 and make up the cheapest form.
05:49:04.214 But even the most valuablequills are often confused with
05:49:06.842 a more widely accessible andcheaper variety of cinnamon.
05:49:25.819 Cassia comes from anotherkind of cinnamon tree,
05:49:28.405 called Cinnamomum cassia,
05:49:30.366 and it doesn't require asmuch time or effort to make.
05:49:33.911 Cassia bark is hard and sturdy,
05:49:36.038 so quills are made asone curled piece of bark
05:49:38.332 without the fillings.
05:49:39.917 Ceylon cinnamon, on the other hand,
05:49:41.502 is tender and soft andneeds those inner layers
05:49:44.380 to prevent the quill from breaking.
05:49:57.226 Cassia is very fragrant and brown,
05:49:59.603 whereas real cinnamon ispaler, with a milder flavor.
05:50:03.065 Cassia also contains, on average,
05:50:05.150 higher levels of coumarin,an organic compound
05:50:08.404 that can cause liver damageif consumed in large amounts.
05:50:12.032 This is why researcherssay Ceylon cinnamon
05:50:14.493 is ultimately the healthier option.
05:50:17.371 But if you're buying cinnamon in the US,
05:50:19.206 it can be hard to tell thedifference between them.
05:50:22.001 Part of the confusion between the two
05:50:23.544 comes from the use of the label cinnamon.
05:50:26.964 In the US, it is legal to label
05:50:28.757 both Ceylon and cassiacinnamon as cinnamon,
05:50:31.844 while in the UK and other countries,
05:50:33.846 cassia must be labeled cassia
05:50:35.764 and cannot be classifiedsimply as cinnamon.
05:50:38.976 Regardless of what it's called in the US,
05:50:41.103 consumers worldwide prefer the real thing.
05:50:45.858 In 2018, Ceylon cinnamon accounted for
05:50:48.277 more global revenuethan any other variety.
05:50:51.196 And even as demand isexpected to grow through 2025,
05:50:54.825 climate change already poses
05:50:56.535 a serious threat to cinnamon production.
05:50:59.163 In recent years,
05:51:00.164 Sri Lanka has experienceddroughts over several months.
05:51:03.834 And these long periods of dry weather
05:51:05.627 can kill cinnamon trees,
05:51:07.421 which need marshy, wet soil to survive.
05:51:10.758 There's also a shortageof cinnamon peelers,
05:51:13.135 another threat to production
05:51:14.428 that's likely to drive up prices.
05:51:17.681 This industry relieson experienced peelers
05:51:20.601 who can practice the difficult work
05:51:22.394 of making these quills over many years.
05:51:52.216 Pule donkey cheese is the most
05:51:54.009 expensive cheese in the world.
05:51:56.386 Produced by only one farm in the world,
05:51:58.764 pule will cost you about$600 for a single pound.
05:52:02.935 Making it requires more time and effort
05:52:04.895 than most other cheeses.
05:52:06.647 You need over 6 1/2gallons of donkey's milk
05:52:09.024 just to make 1 kilogram of cheese.
05:52:11.527 That's 2 1/2 times more
05:52:12.903 than what you need to make mozzarella.
05:52:15.280 So, how does pule compareto other types of cheese?
05:52:18.742 And why is it so expensive?
05:52:23.455 Even in the diverse worldof cheese, pule is unique.
05:52:26.625 There's only one place inthe world that makes it,
05:52:28.919 and that's on this farm
05:52:30.087 in the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve.
05:52:33.924 Slobodan Simić founded thereserve 24 years ago in Serbia.
05:52:38.554 It's one of just three areas
05:52:40.347 in all of former Yugoslavia that protects
05:52:42.474 a special endangeredbreed of Balkan donkey.
05:52:46.937 Pule is made with 60% donkeymilk and 40% goat milk,
05:52:50.816 and it requires months andmany donkeys to produce it.
05:53:22.014 Narrator: There are only about 20 donkeys
05:53:23.307 that produce milk on the farm at a time.
05:53:25.851 And even then, eachone won't produce much.
05:53:28.645 Each donkey is milked carefullyby hand three times a day.
05:53:32.107 If the farmers don'tempty all of the milk,
05:53:33.901 the donkeys won't continue making it.
05:53:54.338 Narrator: Today, farmerscare for 250 donkeys,
05:53:57.382 but they can't always takemilk from all of them.
05:53:59.760 Similar to cows, a female donkey
05:54:01.803 will only produce milkonce it's had a baby.
05:54:04.181 And each one carries a babyfor a year and two weeks.
05:54:07.601 Then farmers must waitanother three months,
05:54:09.853 once the baby has taken milk for itself,
05:54:12.022 before they can begin gatheringtheir own to make cheese.
05:54:15.776 They need 6.6 gallons of milk in total
05:54:18.445 to make just 1 kilogram of cheese.
05:54:20.447 And a donkey produces under1 gallon of milk per day.
05:54:23.909 That's far less thanwhat comes from a cow,
05:54:26.245 which can produce as muchas 15 gallons of milk a day.
05:54:30.040 Each donkey will onlyproduce milk for six months.
05:54:32.876 Then you must wait another year
05:54:34.461 to collect milk fromthat same donkey again.
05:54:38.173 Pule is only sold on this farm
05:54:40.133 and a few others thereserve partners with,
05:54:42.386 another factor that ups the final value.
05:54:45.514 The farm can produce between 50
05:54:47.182 and 70 kilograms of cheese a year,
05:54:49.851 but Slobodan only eversells about a third of that.
05:54:52.980 And it's not just becauseof pule's staggering price.
05:54:56.275 You couldn't legally buy pule cheese
05:54:58.360 in some parts of the world,
05:54:59.611 even if you wanted to.
05:55:19.965 Narrator: Technically,pule cheese can be produced
05:55:22.092 with milk from any type of donkey,
05:55:24.177 and therefore any farmthat raises donkeys.
05:55:27.014 But there's one major roadblock.
05:55:28.932 Just having donkey's milk doesn't mean
05:55:30.851 you have all you need to make this cheese.
05:55:33.270 Pule is made in a very specific way,
05:55:35.397 using a recipe only Slobodan
05:55:37.024 and one other person in the world knows.
05:55:39.985 It's because donkey milk contains less fat
05:55:41.903 than the milk of other animals,
05:55:43.739 which means it holds lessof the protein casein
05:55:45.949 that allows many other cheesesto coagulate on their own.
05:55:49.578 The recipe requires goat milk
05:55:51.121 and a secret mix ofadditives and bacteria.
05:55:54.082 This is what allowsthe milk to form curds,
05:55:56.209 an essential stage ofany cheesemaking process.
05:55:59.338 Without this, it wouldn't bepossible to make pule at all.
05:56:32.329 Narrator: The cheese is finally placed
05:56:33.538 into 50-gram molds to age for a few days.
05:56:36.750 Once removed from the molds,
05:56:37.918 it's set in another room to age
05:56:39.378 for at least a month more.
05:56:41.505 The final product is crumbly and soft
05:56:43.840 with a rich flavor.
05:56:52.557 Narrator: The cost ofpreserving the donkey species
05:56:54.476 is another element to keep in mind
05:56:56.103 when considering pule's huge value.
05:56:58.897 Slobodan must maintain the land,
05:57:00.565 buy food for the donkeys,
05:57:01.775 and hire workers to care for them.
05:57:03.777 In a year, he spends about $100,000
05:57:06.196 just to keep the farm running.
05:57:08.115 And unless producing pule becomes easier
05:57:10.575 or someone else in the worlddiscovers how to make it,
05:57:13.703 nothing is likely to bring down the price
05:57:15.497 of this incredibly rare Serbian cheese.
05:57:18.792 High-quality black opal can cost
05:57:20.794 over $10,000 per carat,
05:57:23.338 making it one of the world'smost expensive gemstones.
05:57:27.134 But mining black opal isn't easy.
05:57:29.970 After investing tens ofthousands of dollars,
05:57:32.514 a miner might not find a single gem.
05:57:35.934 So, what makes black opal so hard to find?
05:57:39.187 And why is it so expensive?
05:57:45.318 Black opal is one of themost enchanting stones
05:57:47.654 in the world, sought after
05:57:49.573 for its seemingly infinitedisplay of colors.
05:57:53.076 Compared to common opal,which is usually one color,
05:57:56.163 black opal exhibits many different colors
05:57:58.498 contrasted by a dark body tone.
05:58:01.042 It's simply the most stunninggemstone on the planet.
05:58:03.670 It's just remarkably beautiful.
05:58:06.131 You can put the thing away for a week,
05:58:07.716 pick it out and look at it,
05:58:08.717 and you can still see things inside it
05:58:10.760 that you've never, ever seen before.
05:58:13.180 Narrator: Opal is found inseveral parts of the world,
05:58:15.390 including Ethiopia, Brazil, and Mexico.
05:58:18.435 But over 90% of the world'sopal comes from Australia.
05:58:22.355 And a lot of the black opal
05:58:23.482 is found here, at Lightning Ridge.
05:58:26.276 It's located on the edge of the Outback,
05:58:28.820 with a population ofjust over 2,000 people.
05:58:33.283 Miners have been searching foropal here for over 100 years.
05:58:37.162 But even for experts, findingblack opal isn't easy.
05:58:40.916 Frederick: If you wereto start mining tomorrow,
05:58:42.959 and once you learn mining skills --
05:58:44.711 and I've been mining for 40 years --
05:58:46.421 we'd be an equal chance,
05:58:48.131 just because there's nothingreally that can tell you,
05:58:51.593 "Oh, there is opal inthat piece of ground"
05:58:53.803 or "There's not opal inthat piece of ground."
05:58:57.182 Narrator: Miners start bydrilling a vertical shaft
05:58:59.309 in an area that they think contains opal.
05:59:03.146 Then they must clearout an underground room
05:59:04.940 large enough to start digging at the rock.
05:59:08.026 Frederick: The basic ideaof mining is basically
05:59:10.320 extract the opal clay out from the ground,
05:59:13.615 put it onto a truck,
05:59:14.866 I take the truck to apuddling site in town,
05:59:17.494 and check if there's opal in that.
05:59:19.538 Narrator: The equipment needed to mine
05:59:20.789 and the cost to register your claim
05:59:22.541 can be extremely expensive.
05:59:24.709 Really, if you wanted to rock up here
05:59:26.586 and be serious, it'd probably ...
05:59:29.130 need $150,000 to $100,000
05:59:30.799 in your pocket to have a go.
05:59:32.842 Narrator: But buying theequipment doesn't guarantee
05:59:34.636 that miners will find black opal.
05:59:37.013 Frederick: Some people will go,
05:59:37.973 "Oh, there's definitely money there,
05:59:39.140 because next door they got $200,000
05:59:41.893 and there was a bit ofcolor drilled up here.
05:59:43.895 It's got to have come over."
05:59:44.729 And there's a whole epic story
05:59:46.690 of why there should be opal there,
05:59:48.400 and you go and dig there, and it's not.
05:59:50.777 Narrator: Miners searchfor areas in the rock
05:59:52.279 with trace amounts of opal.
05:59:54.322 They follow these spots, called "nobbies,"
05:59:56.366 hoping to find moreopal deeper in the rock.
05:59:59.369 Frederick: You'll keepgoing in a straight line
06:00:00.787 till the trace runs out,
06:00:02.581 and then come back wherethere was trace in the wall,
06:00:05.041 go left and right, and then if that stops,
06:00:07.210 then you come back and do it again.
06:00:08.878 And you can come back and do it again.
06:00:10.672 So you've always got thatin the back of your head,
06:00:12.591 you know, "When do Ileave, how long do I stay,
06:00:14.718 have I stayed too long?
06:00:16.219 I'm wasting time, I'm wastingmoney for my next patch."
06:00:21.099 There's a nobby there.
06:00:26.271 When you're in a really good pocket,
06:00:27.897 see how these nobbies are sitting close
06:00:29.399 like that together?
06:00:30.817 They can be like a cluster,like a bunch of grapes.
06:00:33.069 They're all sitting around each other,
06:00:34.237 and they've all got color.
06:00:36.906 Hear that?
06:00:37.907 [scraping]
06:00:39.701 See that sound? It's like glass.
06:00:45.248 So, you get that big one out, there we go.
06:00:55.175 Doesn't have any value. Common black opal.
06:01:02.807 Narrator: Opal is formedwhen silica-rich groundwater
06:01:05.185 hardens in rock over millions of years.
06:01:07.854 Large silica spheres withinthe stone diffract light,
06:01:10.357 creating vibrant colors.
06:01:12.359 That play of color makes each gem unique.
06:01:17.530 But for miners like Frederick,
06:01:19.032 digging for black opal is a gamble.
06:01:21.826 Frederick: The human factoris the biggest factor
06:01:23.620 in finding opal.
06:01:24.746 If you've got a piggybank of $10,000 or $20,000
06:01:27.916 and then all of a sudden in one month
06:01:29.709 or two months you'veblown all of that budget
06:01:32.337 because you've had breakdowns
06:01:33.546 and you've had things occurthat you didn't think of,
06:01:36.007 and then you go, "Well, I'm $20,000 down.
06:01:38.885 What do I do here?"
06:01:40.136 I've been full-time miningfor about over 45 years,
06:01:44.057 and quite often I say to myself,
06:01:45.809 "How did you do it? Howdid you survive that long
06:01:48.269 making it your only job?"
06:01:50.271 I've done ...
06:01:52.148 I've done good. Not great.
06:01:54.818 I haven't been in the millions.
06:01:56.695 I haven't been up there inthe fantasy pocket, you know?
06:02:03.660 Narrator: Once rough opal is extracted
06:02:05.412 and processed from the dirt,
06:02:06.746 it has to be cut and polished.
06:02:08.998 This is when the real valueof the gem is determined.
06:02:12.669 Jo Lindsay: A black opal can vary from ...
06:02:15.088 starting at maybe $1,000 acarat for run of your mill
06:02:19.759 and going right up to tensof thousands of dollars
06:02:23.430 for that really exquisite top quality.
06:02:28.017 The main stone is 241 carats.
06:02:31.396 A few thousand dollars a caratwouldn't be unreasonable.
06:02:36.317 A lot of money. [laughs]
06:02:39.154 Narrator: The color,brightness, and patterns
06:02:41.156 can all influence the price of black opal.
06:02:44.284 Jo: What you're looking forin the best-quality opal
06:02:46.536 is a black stone with really bright color
06:02:51.040 and as much red andother colors as possible.
06:02:55.462 So, the most valuable black opal of all
06:02:58.256 is a really bright red stone
06:03:00.967 on a very black base that just glows.
06:03:04.262 And you don't see them very often at all.
06:03:07.557 Narrator: That lack of supply
06:03:08.808 is a huge driver forthe price of black opal.
06:03:12.270 We can barely keep up withthe demand at the moment.
06:03:15.482 As soon as you find a gem-quality stone,
06:03:19.194 you know you've got a buyer for it.
06:03:22.447 Narrator: Between 2005 and 2006,
06:03:24.949 approximately $30 million of opal
06:03:27.243 was mined at Lightning Ridge.
06:03:29.621 And for fans of black opal,
06:03:31.331 there's simply nothing else like it.
06:03:33.958 It's just a magic stone,
06:03:35.210 and when I came to Lightning Ridge,
06:03:39.047 just the beauty of it captivated me.
06:03:46.012 In 2017, a single violin bow
06:03:48.932 sold at auction for $690,000.
06:03:54.145 You can buy a beginner'sbow for less than $50,
06:03:57.190 but a top-rate professional bow
06:03:59.192 can often cost thousands of dollars.
06:04:06.074 A bow like this is completely
06:04:07.867 handcrafted by skilled artisans.
06:04:10.203 And just one can takean entire week to make.
06:04:14.332 Even the most subtle differences
06:04:15.625 in the way a bow is made
06:04:16.960 will change how well it plays.
06:04:21.130 So, why would someonepay so much for a bow?
06:04:24.217 And what makes it so expensive?
06:04:31.599 Violin bows are far morecomplex than they appear.
06:04:34.894 And so much of whatsets the value of a bow
06:04:37.146 comes down to the artisan who makes it.
06:05:01.963 Narrator: Sandrine Raffinhas spent the last 30 years
06:05:04.757 mastering this craft at her family shop.
06:05:09.387 To begin building a bow,she needs raw materials
06:05:12.056 from specific regions of the world.
06:05:15.393 The most essential arePernambuco wood from Brazil
06:05:18.438 and horsehair from Mongoliathat costs $900 a pound.
06:05:22.775 Typically, horses in cold climates
06:05:24.527 have thicker and stronger hair,
06:05:26.487 which won't break as easily while playing.
06:05:51.346 Narrator: Because of this wear and tear,
06:05:53.222 even professional ones
06:05:54.432 must be rehaired every three months,
06:05:56.935 which is a large part
06:05:58.019 of a bow maker's restoration work.
06:06:02.106 So much of this process relies
06:06:03.691 on the natural instinct of a bow maker.
06:06:23.127 Narrator: By "nervous,"Sandrine refers to bows
06:06:25.213 that are too stiff for amusician to maintain balance.
06:06:28.675 They must be sturdy, yetflexible enough to move fluidly.
06:06:52.573 Narrator: Every smallalteration by the bow maker,
06:06:55.034 from carving the head of the stick
06:06:56.703 to tweaking the curve of the bow,
06:06:58.663 determines how well a bow will play
06:07:00.748 and ultimately sets the final value.
06:07:17.223 Narrator: So even as idealas this wood is for bows,
06:07:19.767 it's up to the bow maker to determine
06:07:21.310 that the shape of the stick is just right.
06:07:24.230 Then Sandrine must considerthe age of the wood,
06:07:26.899 another time-consumingelement of the process.
06:08:08.983 Narrator: Sandrine hasrestored bows made by
06:08:10.693 master artisans fromhundreds of years ago.
06:08:14.363 These bows only remainplayable with routine repairs,
06:08:17.658 but because of their rarityand centuries-old wood,
06:08:20.745 just one of them can be worth
06:08:21.996 tens, even hundreds ofthousands of dollars.
06:08:25.792 Whether a bow is ancient or modern,
06:08:27.960 each one appeals to different people.
06:08:30.129 And it's up to the musician to decide
06:08:31.798 whether the price and qualityof sound are worth it.
06:09:01.244 Narrator: Like Sandrine,many esteemed artisans
06:09:03.329 have studied this craft in France,
06:09:05.540 where prominent French bow makers like
06:09:07.166 François Xavier Tourtedeveloped the modern bow.
06:09:11.462 Bow makers don't typically go to school,
06:09:13.381 as you would with violin making.
06:09:15.466 Instead, many must train as an apprentice
06:09:17.593 for three years under a master bow maker.
06:09:21.347 That tradition continuesfor Sandrine today,
06:09:24.308 as she shows the next generation
06:09:26.269 how to make bows by hand.
06:09:50.126 Narrator: This is standard sea salt.
06:09:52.962 But after 30 days, it'll become this.
06:09:57.216 High-quality bamboo salt costs almost $100
06:10:00.094 for an 8.5-ounce jar,
06:10:02.054 making it the mostexpensive salt in the world.
06:10:05.558 So, what is bamboo salt used for?
06:10:08.060 And why is it so expensive?
06:10:12.773 For hundreds of years,
06:10:13.983 Koreans have used bamboo salt for cooking
06:10:16.444 and as a form of traditional medicine.
06:10:19.071 It's made by placing seasalt inside of bamboo
06:10:21.991 and roasting it at a high temperature.
06:10:24.535 The goal is to infuse the saltwith minerals from the bamboo
06:10:27.622 and to remove any impurities.
06:10:30.124 But the premium compared toother types of salt is steep.
06:10:33.836 Nine-times-roasted bamboo salt,
06:10:35.755 sometimes referred toas "purple bamboo salt,"
06:10:38.382 can cost over 10 times theprice of pink Himalayan salt.
06:10:42.220 Most of that cost comes fromthe labor-intensive process.
06:10:46.015 Every single step is done by hand.
06:11:03.574 Narrator: The process startsby cutting 3-year-old bamboo
06:11:06.202 into uniform trunks,
06:11:08.120 leaving one side closed asa container for the salt.
06:11:13.709 Sea salt from the west coast of Korea
06:11:15.503 is densely packed by hand into the bamboo.
06:11:22.843 Workers load filled bamboo onto a cart
06:11:25.429 and push it into a kiln.
06:11:28.224 Traditionally, only pine logs are used.
06:11:33.688 This process takes around 12 to 14 hours.
06:11:39.902 Baking everything atover 800 degrees Celsius
06:11:42.655 burns away the bamboo,leaving a column of salt.
06:11:48.286 But the process has only just begun.
06:12:10.808 Narrator: The ninth andfinal roast is the hottest,
06:12:13.144 at over 1,000 degrees Celsius.
06:12:15.938 It's fired in a special kilnand operated by an expert.
06:12:19.817 Shin Tae-joong has been making bamboo salt
06:12:21.986 for over 20 years.
06:12:25.239 That experience is extremely important,
06:12:27.575 because any error at this stage
06:12:29.327 could result in wasting a month of work.
06:12:34.498 At this temperature, the saltand bamboo completely melt
06:12:37.293 and drain into a mold.
06:12:42.631 After a few days of cooling,
06:12:44.008 a blackened rocklike structure remains.
06:12:47.553 This is nine-times-roasted bamboo salt.
06:12:51.015 Workers carefully break this down by hand,
06:12:53.142 trying not to waste any material.
06:12:58.856 After a month of work,
06:13:00.024 it's ready to be packaged and sold.
06:13:23.422 Narrator: The final price varies
06:13:24.548 depending on where you buyit and what form it's in.
06:13:27.009 But nine-times-roasted bamboosalt doesn't come cheap.
06:13:54.662 Narrator: The health benefits of food
06:13:55.955 have always played an importantrole in Korean culture.
06:13:59.417 For centuries, bamboo saltbaked two to three times
06:14:02.586 has been used intraditional Korean medicine.
06:14:05.506 But in the 20th century,
06:14:06.799 the nine-times-roastingprocess was developed.
06:14:09.593 Manufacturers say this processhas the lowest toxicity
06:14:12.471 and highest mineral content.
06:14:14.682 Today, it's used forcooking, toothpaste, soap,
06:14:17.351 and various remedies.
06:14:42.460 Narrator: Proponents of bamboosalt say that it can help
06:14:44.503 with everything fromdigestion to oral health,
06:14:47.298 skin care, and inflammation
06:14:49.175 and that it even has anticancer effects.
06:14:52.344 The proposed medical benefitshave likely helped it
06:14:54.930 maintain its high price.
06:14:56.932 But there hasn't beenenough scientific study
06:14:58.726 to fully back up all of these claims.
06:15:01.687 Studies have shown that bamboosalt contains higher levels
06:15:04.482 of iron, potassium, and calcium
06:15:06.484 compared to regular sea salt
06:15:08.277 and that it could improveyour immune system.
06:15:10.905 But these beneficial minerals constitute
06:15:12.823 only a small percentage --
06:15:14.575 the majority of bamboosalt is sodium chloride.
06:15:17.995 Even with lower toxicity,
06:15:19.705 it's unclear how potentthe health benefits are.
06:15:23.083 In 2016, the WHO wrote in a report
06:15:26.045 that "the composition of specialty salts
06:15:28.380 poses no toxicological risks
06:15:30.674 but does not offer any relevant
06:15:32.301 nutritional benefits either."
06:15:34.803 The full benefits of bamboosalt compared to sea salt
06:15:37.431 have yet to be extensively researched.
06:15:39.934 But despite that, bamboosalt continues to be popular.
06:15:45.898 Narrator: Even in thehigh-end world of jewelry,
06:15:48.317 Cuban link chains are a symbol of luxury.
06:15:52.071 This 18-karat gold chain is worth $27,000.
06:15:56.825 And some of the most valuable chains
06:15:58.786 will cost 10 times that.
06:16:01.247 Making a single chain requires the skill
06:16:03.541 of more than five experienced jewelers
06:16:06.126 and can take over 12 hours.
06:16:09.046 So, how exactly areCuban link chains made?
06:16:11.882 And is that what makes them so expensive?
06:16:18.430 Somebody had to literallytake 14 hours of their day
06:16:22.226 running hot steel through machinery
06:16:26.272 to then turn it by hand,
06:16:28.232 to then file it by hand,
06:16:31.527 to then polish it by hand.
06:16:33.487 You're not just wearing a chain,
06:16:35.406 you're wearing somebody'sblood, sweat, and tears,
06:16:39.618 and passion around your neck.
06:16:43.289 Narrator: The originof the Cuban link chain
06:16:44.832 is tough to pinpoint, but itlikely didn't start in Cuba.
06:16:48.586 It was a quintessentialpart of hip-hop style
06:16:51.213 in the '70s and '80sand grew in popularity
06:16:54.508 as hip-hop became moremainstream in the US.
06:16:57.845 But not all Cuban linkchains are created equal.
06:17:00.764 Many Cuban link chainsare made by machines
06:17:03.559 in countries like theUS, Italy, and China,
06:17:06.687 but the authentic -- andmost expensive -- ones
06:17:09.481 are made by hand at justa few shops in Miami.
06:17:12.985 Gus Villalobos: When youmove into the higher end of
06:17:15.279 Cuban link chains, which,you get into the $50,000,
06:17:17.948 $80,000 $100,000 chains,
06:17:19.908 those have to be handmade.
06:17:22.286 One, because of the attention to detail.
06:17:24.747 The file, the tight links.
06:17:26.790 Chino: It's like goingto a Ferrari dealer.
06:17:28.250 You could buy a Ferrari off the lot,
06:17:30.252 or you could have it made to how you want.
06:17:33.422 This is a custom build.
06:17:35.007 Narrator: A chain likethis goes through 30
06:17:37.343 manual -- and time-consuming -- stages.
06:17:40.429 The skills come from your ability
06:17:42.222 and practice and knowledge.
06:17:44.266 Worldwide, I can't tellyou an exact number.
06:17:46.602 Within South Florida,there's a handful of people,
06:17:48.854 literally a handful ofpeople, that can do this.
06:17:51.857 Narrator: Not only is this process
06:17:53.067 incredibly labor intensive,it's also dangerous.
06:17:57.071 Chino and his crew workwith 1,000-degree flames
06:17:59.698 to melt down the goldand form it into a bar.
06:18:04.078 Chino: You've definitelygot to be paying attention
06:18:05.329 to what you're doing in this job.
06:18:06.789 One mess-up, you're gonna hurt yourself.
06:18:11.627 There has been peoplethat have lost fingers
06:18:13.879 in this business.
06:18:16.340 Narrator: That bar passesthrough a rolling machine
06:18:18.467 as many as 12 times,just to make it thinner.
06:18:22.137 Each of the nine jewelersat Gold Fever Miami
06:18:24.515 has a specific job.
06:18:26.308 At the stretch bench, onejeweler can spend over an hour
06:18:29.228 just stretching the wire to length.
06:18:31.647 Chino: This isn't dirt,this is actual gold.
06:18:33.941 If you look at my hands,
06:18:34.775 you'll see the flakes of gold on them.
06:18:36.652 Narrator: This wire then getscurled around a copper rod
06:18:39.071 to form the shape for the links.
06:18:41.323 For smaller chains, adrill gets the job done.
06:18:44.284 But thicker ones need thestrength of two jewelers.
06:18:50.541 The most crucial stage ofthe process comes next.
06:18:53.335 It also requires the most skill.
06:18:57.005 Gus: The soldering isthe most intricate part
06:18:59.925 of what you're doing.
06:19:01.093 Essentially, what you're doingis you're heating up gold,
06:19:04.638 and right before it beginsto break down and melt,
06:19:08.517 you're introducing solder.
06:19:10.811 Narrator: Solder is another type of metal
06:19:12.354 that's used to permanentlyclose each link.
06:19:15.858 Gus: So it's the balance of applying
06:19:17.776 the right amount of flame
06:19:19.445 with the right amount of technique
06:19:22.740 to when those two metals meet,
06:19:24.783 that solder melts and fuses into the gold.
06:19:28.245 So, if you left too long,
06:19:30.873 the whole thing is just liquid gold.
06:19:33.041 If done way too early, thesolder won't melt properly
06:19:36.295 and you won't get thatfusion between the links.
06:19:39.798 You can't mess that up,
06:19:40.924 or you're going tocreate gaps in the chain.
06:19:43.010 And you can't be scared to stop
06:19:44.970 and just do it all over again.
06:19:47.014 Narrator: It's no secret theprice of gold plays a part
06:19:49.349 in determining the cost of these chains.
06:19:51.602 An ounce of gold costs $1,700 today,
06:19:55.522 but even the most high-end Cuban links
06:19:57.483 are mixed with something else.
06:19:59.818 Gold itself is a very soft material --
06:20:02.571 typically too soft to bemade into jewelry on its own.
06:20:06.784 It has to be alloyed with other metals.
06:20:09.620 White gold, for example,is an alloy of gold
06:20:11.830 made of white metals, likesilver, zinc, and nickel.
06:20:15.417 Those metals make the gold more pliable,
06:20:18.045 allowing it to be stretched and twisted
06:20:19.963 during the jewelry-making process.
06:20:22.174 But they can be especiallydifficult to work with.
06:20:25.552 One small movement canmake all the difference.
06:20:30.349 In rare cases, with whitegold, this can happen.
06:20:33.811 Gus: This is the reasonwhy it costs so much.
06:20:36.605 If any one of these links break,
06:20:38.273 you then have to take itback to the soldering table,
06:20:40.943 resolder it, and bring itback here and turn it again.
06:20:46.073 Narrator: Once the linksare properly turned
06:20:47.950 and tightened, the chain will lie flat.
06:20:51.995 A jeweler must then file down the chain
06:20:53.956 so that each side is leveland looks exactly the same.
06:20:59.545 Gus: And here is wherethe passion of the jeweler
06:21:02.256 comes into hand, to howbeautiful he can make that shape.
06:21:13.600 Narrator: But theseCuban links in particular
06:21:15.519 didn't become so sought after
06:21:17.479 or so valuable until recently.
06:21:20.816 Google Trends shows thatsearches for Cuban link chains
06:21:23.652 began taking off in 2012.
06:21:26.321 And in the last two years,
06:21:27.739 Gold Fever Miami's saleshave grown 100 times over.
06:21:31.743 The shop used to sell $2,000worth of Cuban links a month.
06:21:35.747 That number is now over $200,000.
06:21:38.876 Whether you're the most famous
06:21:40.335 or you're just starting off,
06:21:41.795 to legitimize yourself as a rapper,
06:21:44.006 you have to have jewelry.
06:21:45.465 And if you have jewelry,
06:21:46.717 you have a Miami Cuban link chain.
06:21:48.760 Narrator: In 2012, Jay-Zwore one of the priciest
06:21:51.263 Cuban links made at thetime, worth $200,000.
06:21:55.225 A year later, Daddy Yankee debuted
06:21:57.227 his 10-kilo Cuban linkchain in a music video.
06:22:00.188 And there's even more tractionin the music industry now.
06:22:04.776 Gus: They're so intertwinedwith pop culture,
06:22:07.321 more specifically hip-hop and reggaeton.
06:22:10.532 Just about every songthat has a music video
06:22:14.119 will have a rapper witha Miami Cuban link chain.
06:22:17.414 Chino: It's become, in away, like a status symbol.
06:22:21.877 We have customers thatwant to match their Rolexes
06:22:25.088 to their chains.
06:22:26.840 Narrator: These versions areoften decked out with diamonds,
06:22:29.635 which naturally makes them pricier.
06:22:31.970 But Gus doesn't see demandslowing for chains like this
06:22:34.848 or the more modest ones.
06:22:36.725 Right now, as of March of 2021,
06:22:41.188 we are pumping anywherefrom 10 to 15 kilos
06:22:44.524 in five days, so per five weeks.
06:22:47.861 And we still can't keepup with the demand.
06:22:50.489 We still have a wait timeof five to seven weeks.
06:22:53.700 Narrator: This, coupled withthe steep price of gold,
06:22:56.286 means prices likelywon't drop anytime soon.
06:23:02.042 Narrator: Cashews grow inselect tropical climates
06:23:04.628 around the world
06:23:05.837 from the bottom of ahanging fruit like this.
06:23:09.424 Just 1 kilogram of cashewscan cost $10 wholesale.
06:23:13.595 That's over seven timesas much as peanuts.
06:23:17.099 And in the US, retailprices for whole cashews
06:23:20.185 can reach $15 per pound.
06:23:23.522 But without intensive, precise processing,
06:23:26.483 these nuts wouldn't be edible at all.
06:23:29.111 So how exactly are cashews processed?
06:23:31.947 And is this what makes them so expensive?
06:23:36.535 In 2017, the world ate
06:23:38.620 770,000 metric tons of cashews.
06:23:42.874 They're one of the mostpopular and valuable nuts
06:23:45.419 in the world, worth over $6 billion today.
06:23:50.090 Cashews grow in tropicallocations like India,
06:23:53.343 Vietnam, Ivory Coast,and here, in Sri Lanka.
06:23:58.598 The trees are a member of thesame family as poison ivy,
06:24:02.352 and like poison ivy,
06:24:03.687 cashew plants contain atoxin called urushiol.
06:24:07.357 It's found in the plant itself
06:24:09.317 and the brown oil inside a nut's shell.
06:24:11.945 It can cause burns, itches, and blisters,
06:24:14.656 which is why unprocessed cashews
06:24:16.408 are considered dangerous to eat or touch.
06:24:19.453 It's also why they requiremore rigorous processing
06:24:22.706 than other nuts.
06:24:32.632 Narrator: Each fruit growsjust one shelled nut,
06:24:34.968 called a drupe, whichworkers separate by hand.
06:24:40.015 The nuts must then dry under the sun
06:24:41.808 to help draw out some ofthe shell's caustic liquid.
06:24:46.438 The most difficult and dangerous step
06:24:48.732 is splitting open the nut,
06:24:50.233 since toxic oil still coats the drupes.
06:24:55.489 Cashews are brittle,
06:24:56.656 so factories used to do this step manually
06:24:58.909 to ensure machineswouldn't break the nuts.
06:25:02.037 But doing this by hand hasfrequently raised issues
06:25:04.664 within the industry.
06:25:06.416 NGOs have called out some factories
06:25:08.376 for overworking employeesand putting workers
06:25:10.837 at risk of burning themselves
06:25:12.506 if they can't afford tobuy gloves for protection.
06:25:16.426 Today, machines are advanced enough
06:25:18.303 to crack the shells cleanly,
06:25:20.013 keeping the majority of nuts intact
06:25:22.015 and helping minimize risks to workers.
06:25:51.002 Narrator: After a machinesplits open the shells,
06:25:53.255 the next two crucial stagestotally depend on workers,
06:25:57.092 who have to do them by hand.
06:26:01.888 The nuts are roasted to ensure, again,
06:26:04.432 that the toxic liquid inside is destroyed.
06:26:09.479 The next stage is particularly tedious,
06:26:11.857 as it relies entirely on handiwork.
06:26:15.068 Workers must peel off the husk,
06:26:17.028 or the dry outer coveringthat surrounds each nut,
06:26:19.990 because it's high in tannins
06:26:21.408 and could irritate your throat.
06:26:24.452 Removing it is a skillone masters with practice.
06:26:28.832 Experienced workers de-skin only about
06:26:31.251 2.5 kilograms of cashews each night.
06:26:34.754 This step is not only difficult
06:26:36.381 but also has the biggest impact on price.
06:26:53.773 Narrator: Cashews aregraded by several features,
06:26:56.026 like color, weight, and condition.
06:26:58.778 Large whole nuts are most valuable.
06:27:23.303 Narrator: Because cashews canonly be harvested once a year,
06:27:26.765 growers like Lahiru save aportion of the nuts in stock
06:27:30.310 so that they can continue making a profit
06:27:32.145 in the months ahead.
06:27:33.980 But it comes at a steep cost.
06:27:36.191 Just stocking the nuts costs Lahiru
06:27:38.360 more than $65,000 each year.
06:28:12.811 Narrator: This causes prices
06:28:13.853 to fluctuate a bit year-round.
06:28:16.022 In December, Lahiru'ssupply has decreased,
06:28:18.733 so prices typically increase.
06:28:21.278 But it also depends on eachcountry's supply chain.
06:28:24.614 While Sri Lanka processes and sells
06:28:26.700 many of its own cashews domestically,
06:28:29.244 other countries exportmuch of what they grow.
06:28:32.956 It's likely that many of the cashews
06:28:34.791 you buy in the US or Europe
06:28:36.876 were grown in Africa,processed in Vietnam or India,
06:28:40.547 and finally exportedto the Western market.
06:28:44.175 Africa produces half of theworld's supply of cashews.
06:28:47.887 Ivory Coast, for example,
06:28:49.306 produced about 730,000 metric tons
06:28:52.100 of raw cashews in 2019.
06:28:54.811 But it exported over 90% of that.
06:28:57.814 This is because Ivory Coastand other African countries
06:29:00.900 still don't have a robustprocessing industry.
06:29:04.154 Ivory Coast plans to expanddomestic processing by 2024.
06:29:08.074 But without it, cashews aresignificantly less valuable.
06:29:12.287 In 2018, the export price ofcashews processed in India
06:29:16.458 and exported to Europe was 250% higher
06:29:19.836 than the price paid toIvory Coast farmers.
06:29:23.548 Vietnam, on the other hand,
06:29:25.008 was one of the first countriesto invest in automation,
06:29:27.844 making it a key locationfor processing cashews.
06:29:31.473 Today, Vietnam is the largestcashew exporter in the world.
06:29:35.060 In just the first three months of 2021,
06:29:37.395 the country exported over108,000 tons of cashews.
06:29:42.525 Automation has also lessenedthe need to hire workers,
06:29:46.154 which is a reason manyfactories in India and Sri Lanka
06:29:49.157 still process manually.
06:30:07.342 Narrator: By hand or machine,
06:30:09.052 processing cashews is no easy task.
06:30:12.222 And the world's climate crisiscould make it even harder.
06:30:16.017 A 2013 report on theclimate's impact on cashews
06:30:19.270 shows unseasonal rains and heavy dew
06:30:21.439 can impact the qualityand quantity of the nuts.
06:30:24.818 Just this year, Lahiru'sharvest came late because of it.
06:30:48.633 Narrator: Amidst climate challenges,
06:30:50.051 cashews continue to be popular.
06:30:52.720 Healthy-eating trends arekey to driving demand,
06:30:55.807 along with the versatilityof the cashew itself --
06:30:58.852 another reason the nutremains so valuable.
06:31:01.855 Whether used as a snack, cooking paste,
06:31:04.232 or an alternative to milk or butter,
06:31:06.317 cashews have manyapplications around the world.
06:31:09.904 Researchers predict the market will grow
06:31:11.573 to $7 billion by 2025.
06:31:15.076 And although cashews are currently cheaper
06:31:17.078 than they've been in recent years,
06:31:18.955 demand is likely to driveprices higher in the future.
06:31:26.087 Narrator: This is saidto be the world's oldest
06:31:28.548 leather-making tradition.
06:31:32.010 It's called vegetable tanning,
06:31:34.095 and it's a process that has been perfected
06:31:36.139 over generations here in Tuscany.
06:31:40.602 Artisans spend four to six weeks
06:31:42.937 perfecting each piece that they touch.
06:31:47.358 Vegetable-tanned leather isconsidered higher quality
06:31:50.195 and will last longer thansynthetically treated leather.
06:31:53.490 It takes at least 28 times longer to make,
06:31:56.659 which is part of the reasonwhy vegetable-tanned leather
06:31:59.078 only makes up roughly 10% ofall leather available today.
06:32:05.210 It can also cost around three times more
06:32:07.795 than the cheaper version.
06:32:10.340 So how exactly isvegetable-tanned leather made?
06:32:14.260 And why is it so expensive?
06:32:24.938 Vegetable tanning is said todate back to roughly 6000 BCE,
06:32:29.692 when people living in early civilizations
06:32:32.070 sought a way to make animal skins
06:32:34.239 resistant to weather and decay.
06:32:37.158 Genuine vegetable-tanned leather
06:32:38.660 uses these natural tanning agents
06:32:40.870 from sources like quebracho,chestnut, or mimosa trees.
06:32:46.751 The substances, known as tannins,
06:32:49.128 will naturally bind to thecollagen proteins in a hide,
06:32:52.840 turning it into leather as we know it.
06:32:55.009 Just as they do for trees,
06:32:56.886 the tannins protect hidesbeing turned into leather
06:32:59.472 from bacteria and other substances,
06:33:02.016 which gives leather the longevity
06:33:03.601 and versatility that it's known for.
06:33:06.354 Until the 19th century,
06:33:07.772 vegetable tanning was theonly way to make leather.
06:33:10.942 But today, 90% of all leather goods
06:33:13.528 are made using chrome or mineral tanning,
06:33:16.197 a leather-making processthat uses synthetic tannins.
06:33:19.993 On first glance, consumers may think
06:33:21.953 this softer leather is of higher quality,
06:33:24.414 but it won't have the same life span.
06:33:37.969 When the hides arrive at the tannery,
06:33:39.971 they soak in water for 24hours to remove the salt
06:33:43.349 that kept them preserved on their journey.
06:34:08.082 Narrator: Then theyare dehaired and limed,
06:34:10.543 a process that prepares the skins
06:34:12.420 to receive the tanning substances.
06:34:15.548 Leather makers add the hides,along with the tannins,
06:34:18.551 to this large wooden rotatingvessel known as a drum.
06:34:22.472 The hides stay here forthree to seven weeks to tan.
06:34:27.477 Here's where you can beginto see the differences
06:34:29.812 between vegetable-tanned leather
06:34:31.564 and its modern-dayalternative, chrome tanning,
06:34:34.442 where hides sit in a drum withwater and synthetic extracts
06:34:37.987 for only a single day.
06:34:39.906 Just this difference in production time
06:34:42.283 adds to the price ofvegetable-tanned leather.
06:34:45.703 Once the hides have beenremoved from the drums,
06:34:48.039 skilled artisans inspect each piece.
06:34:51.209 Depending on the final product,
06:34:52.835 the leather can beretanned, dyed, or greased.
06:34:57.090 This process is known as fatliquoring.
06:35:00.885 These three procedures can bedone to adjust the elasticity,
06:35:04.347 softness, or color of the leather.
06:35:07.225 Whether they happen dependson the vision of the artisan.
06:35:35.294 Narrator: The tanned hidesdry on hooks for several days
06:35:37.880 in a special environment-controlled room.
06:35:41.718 The humidity and temperature in the room
06:35:43.636 have to be just right.
06:35:45.471 This is something thatcan't be learned quickly
06:35:47.724 and shows the skill ofthese leather makers.
06:35:51.602 The time of the year, the weather,
06:35:53.604 and the humidity in the factory itself
06:35:56.107 can all play a part in adjusting
06:35:57.817 for this perfect temperature.
06:36:00.486 If any hide is overdried,
06:36:02.155 it must be taken back tothe drums and reconditioned.
06:36:07.618 You can tell vegetable-tannedleather apart
06:36:09.620 from mineral-tanned leather
06:36:11.038 by its two defining qualities.
06:36:13.624 First, it changes color in the light
06:36:15.585 and develops a rich patina.
06:36:18.087 A patina is the shinethat develops over time
06:36:20.631 on a leather product that makes it unique.
06:36:23.968 Second, vegetable-tanned leather
06:36:25.553 will become more supple with age.
06:36:27.680 These qualities are made possible
06:36:29.223 by the natural properties of the leather.
06:36:33.436 Vegetable tanning leaves thehides in an organic state
06:36:36.856 that lets them age like skin.
06:36:39.358 With synthetically treated leather,
06:36:41.235 each piece is the same.
06:36:43.029 That's by design.
06:36:44.947 Leather produced withvegetable tanning, however,
06:36:47.325 will garner the most beautiful patina
06:36:49.368 as it is worn or used.
06:36:51.496 No two pieces will age the same.
06:36:57.168 After it's dry, the hidegoes to the staking machine,
06:37:00.213 where small hammersrepeatedly pound the leather
06:37:02.799 to make it softer.
06:37:04.592 Sometimes the leather mills forseveral hours in a dry drum,
06:37:08.304 giving it a special natural grain.
06:37:14.977 In the end, the leather istrimmed, measured, and packaged.
06:37:22.026 Finished products arevalued for their variations,
06:37:24.612 which can add to the price.
06:37:26.948 Artisans take pride in thenatural markings and differences
06:37:30.201 that prove the leather's authenticity.
06:38:04.777 Narrator: All vegetable-tannedleather from Tuscany
06:38:06.737 must meet a set of specific standards
06:38:09.073 for the consortium toverify it as authentic.
06:38:11.868 Tanneries must useall-natural, raw materials
06:38:15.037 and ensure that no animalis killed for its skin.
06:38:18.749 And in the end, the most important mission
06:38:20.918 of vegetable tanneries in Tuscany
06:38:23.087 is to keep a cultural craftalive, no matter the cost.
06:38:39.937 Rolls-Royce makes some of the world's
06:38:41.856 most luxurious cars.
06:38:44.400 Known for producinghand-crafted automobiles
06:38:46.944 that promise a seamless"magical carpet ride"
06:38:49.447 for its customers,
06:38:50.740 a Rolls-Royce car does not come cheap.
06:38:53.784 These are some of thebest-selling Rolls-Royce models,
06:38:57.204 and these are their entry-level prices.
06:39:01.292 But with virtually unlimited optional
06:39:03.127 extras, upgrades, and customizations,
06:39:06.213 the true cost of a bespokeRolls-Royce has no limits.
06:39:10.927 In fact, Rolls-Royce refuses to even
06:39:13.220 discuss its base prices.
06:39:15.139 Rhodri Good: There isn'treally a specific base price
06:39:16.933 which we would discussbecause it really depends
06:39:19.143 on each customer as an individual
06:39:21.395 and the bespoke options, which they like
06:39:23.147 to design and developwith our bespoke team.
06:39:27.026 Narrator: So, what are someof these bespoke extras?
06:39:29.737 And is that what makesRolls-Royce so expensive?
06:39:32.740 David Dean: One of the firstobvious starting points
06:39:34.659 probably is the color.
06:39:35.952 We have a palette of 44,000-plus colors.
06:39:39.372 We replicate people's lipsticks,
06:39:41.374 something from your house,
06:39:42.792 something you own,
06:39:43.751 something you've seen.
06:39:45.044 Even we've done the dogof an owner, a red setter.
06:39:48.923 So we exactly replicate them,
06:39:50.758 whether it be by the DNA,the chemistry, or whatever.
06:39:54.053 For us, it's unique.
06:39:55.179 It'll be registered as your color,
06:39:56.597 and you can give it aname, and it's yours.
06:39:59.642 And if someone else has seen it
06:40:01.852 and wants to use that exact finish,
06:40:04.230 we have to go to that personand ask their permission.
06:40:07.066 When we go to the paint shop,
06:40:08.150 you'll see it's calledthe Surface Finish Centre,
06:40:10.611 because it's a bit of an insult to say,
06:40:12.279 "We're painting the car."
06:40:13.656 It's more than that.
06:40:15.032 You're going to have atleast seven layers of coat.
06:40:17.743 There's primers, there'sbase coats, there's color,
06:40:20.830 and, unusually, we put ontwo clear coats of lacquer.
06:40:23.916 But you could have upto 23 layers of coating,
06:40:27.128 which we've done before,
06:40:29.046 equating to about 45 kilogramsin weight just of coat.
06:40:34.218 Narrator: In addition to theendless variations of color,
06:40:37.054 Rolls-Royce customerscan infuse their paint
06:40:39.390 with materials to create special effects.
06:40:42.893 One particularly wealthycustomer went one step further,
06:40:46.188 requesting the addition of 1,000 diamonds.
06:40:49.108 Dean: He wanted a bit moresparkle in the finish,
06:40:51.986 so he gave us a bag of diamonds.
06:40:53.779 We crushed them.
06:40:54.822 They were infused into the paint.
06:40:57.658 Narrator: Remarkably,the detailed paintwork
06:40:59.827 on Rolls-Royce cars is doneby hand by just one person.
06:41:04.582 Mark Court: My name is Mark Court,
06:41:06.250 and I am the coachlinerfor Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
06:41:09.503 A coachliner means that I am able to put
06:41:12.798 this pinstripe onto the side of the car.
06:41:15.801 The uniqueness is the fact
06:41:17.428 that I do it completely freehand,
06:41:19.388 and I'm the only one withinRolls-Royce that can do this.
06:41:22.141 That's, like, worldwide withinthe Rolls-Royce BMW Group.
06:41:26.353 So, the brushes I use ismade of squirrel hair.
06:41:29.690 We found that most brushesnowadays are man-made,
06:41:33.778 which tends to leave brushmarks within these lines.
06:41:37.031 This is a natural hair,
06:41:39.075 and this natural hair tendsto leave no marks at all.
06:41:42.453 So, we work to one standard,which is a higher standard,
06:41:46.290 so we use one that leavesno brush marks at all.
06:41:49.335 Narrator: And if customerswithout a coachline
06:41:51.504 decide to add one to their car,
06:41:53.422 Mark is on hand to travelworldwide with his paintbrush.
06:41:57.093 Court: As normal with Rolls-Royce,
06:41:58.761 Rolls-Royce never comes back to us.
06:42:00.346 We go to it.
06:42:01.263 So if it's in Dubai, so be it.
06:42:04.433 That's where I have to go.
06:42:08.979 Narrator: There are severalunmistakable features
06:42:11.107 of every Rolls-Royce exterior.
06:42:13.484 The handmade pantheon grille,
06:42:15.694 the self-righting wheel centers
06:42:17.488 that ensure the RR logo is never rotated,
06:42:20.658 and the Spirit of Ecstasy ornament.
06:42:23.285 In fact, in 2003, BMW paid $65 million
06:42:28.207 to acquire the rights to the Rolls-Royce
06:42:30.167 name, symbol, and the Spirit of Ecstasy.
06:42:33.921 But it's inside the carwhere luxury - and cost -
06:42:36.882 dramatically increases.
06:42:39.260 To create a virtually silent ride,
06:42:41.679 Rolls-Royce adds approximately 300 pounds
06:42:44.598 of acoustic insulation around the cabin.
06:42:47.685 Its tire manufacturer Continental
06:42:49.854 even developed special foam-filled tires,
06:42:52.815 which reduced the noiseof the road by 9 decibels.
06:42:56.610 The results were so profound
06:42:58.320 that Rolls-Royce removedsome soundproofing
06:43:00.823 to avoid causing acousticsensory deprivation.
06:43:06.036 The dashboard of the Rolls-Royce Phantom
06:43:08.164 can even become a bespoke art gallery.
06:43:10.958 Customers have commissionedartists to produce
06:43:12.918 all sorts of designs for this space,
06:43:15.212 including this gold-plated, 3D-printed
06:43:18.174 stainless steel installation
06:43:20.092 that replicates thecustomer's DNA profile.
06:43:23.929 Another shining feature of Rolls-Royce
06:43:26.223 is the Starlight Headliner,
06:43:28.058 an intricate series offiber-optic roof lights
06:43:30.853 that recreate the night sky.
06:43:34.023 Alexandra Benga: It takesup to 16 hours to build
06:43:36.066 the Starlight Headliners.
06:43:37.860 We're starting by drilling it,
06:43:39.445 and we perforate every single hole
06:43:42.781 to thread fiber-opticthrough every single hole.
06:43:46.160 We've got up to 1,340 holes.
06:43:49.872 We're doing this to achievethe stars in the sky,
06:43:54.585 so we're going to have the sky
06:43:57.004 in the night covered with stars.
06:44:00.466 Narrator: As with all things Rolls-Royce,
06:44:02.134 customers can createbespoke starlight designs,
06:44:05.221 including randomlygenerated shooting stars.
06:44:08.474 One customer even had their design matched
06:44:10.935 to exactly replicate theconstellation of stars
06:44:13.604 from the night they were born.
06:44:16.273 The embroidery on theupholstery is also tailor-made
06:44:19.276 to the customers' design choice.
06:44:21.362 Joshua Liles: So, there'sno real standard process
06:44:23.948 that's repeated with embroidery,
06:44:25.324 just because every single design
06:44:27.284 is completely unique to the customer.
06:44:29.119 It's not just a case ofscanning in an image,
06:44:31.580 turning it into embroidery.
06:44:33.082 Every single aspect ofthe image is thought out.
06:44:35.709 The different angles of the stitch
06:44:37.253 will reflect the light in a different way.
06:44:38.754 So rather than it just being a flat image,
06:44:40.381 we're trying to bring itout to that next level.
06:44:42.216 So, it's almost three-dimensional,
06:44:44.593 like a hologram effect,
06:44:45.552 that you can get from our stitching.
06:44:48.013 Narrator: The mostcomplex embroidery project
06:44:50.015 Rolls-Royce has completed
06:44:51.558 is this special Rose Phantom model,
06:44:54.186 which consists of 1 millionindividual stitches.
06:44:57.690 Liles: The Rose Phantom is
06:45:00.150 the biggest embroidery we've done to date.
06:45:01.860 We'll have to map out exactly what order
06:45:04.071 we're putting all thoseembroideries onto the leather
06:45:06.865 so that they all join up tomatch some of the stitching.
06:45:09.910 There's no tolerance. Itcan't be out by a millimeter,
06:45:12.955 otherwise it's completely written off.
06:45:14.707 Just take a small aspectof the Rose Phantom,
06:45:18.168 It's a good example of the development
06:45:19.795 of one of the butterflies.
06:45:20.879 What seems relativelysimple in, like, an image
06:45:23.674 actually becomes verycomplex for embroidery.
06:45:25.843 So for the Phantom Rose Headliner,
06:45:27.970 there's a few techniquesthat we hadn't used before.
06:45:30.431 Because of the scaleof the Rose Headliner,
06:45:33.600 we had to break it downinto individual elements.
06:45:35.269 So each individual butterfly,
06:45:37.479 the flower heads themselves,
06:45:38.731 and then all the vines and leaves.
06:45:40.065 So you can see here,
06:45:41.108 it's basically different layering
06:45:42.943 of different-colored stitchesin different densities.
06:45:45.863 And by building those up,
06:45:46.822 we can create that sort of fade effect
06:45:48.532 where it's darker to the center,
06:45:50.451 fades out towards the wings,
06:45:51.702 fine-tune them to thequality that we expect,
06:45:54.621 and then start combining it
06:45:56.081 and bringing it all togetherfor the whole headliner.
06:45:58.542 Narrator: Rolls-Roycehas seen a boom in sales
06:46:00.377 over the last 10 years.
06:46:02.046 In 2019, sales increased by roughly 25%
06:46:06.175 to 5,152 units,
06:46:09.345 with the average age of a Roll-Royce owner
06:46:11.722 dropping from late 50s to mid 40s.
06:46:15.684 Take Drake for example.
06:46:17.936 His Bushukan model,
06:46:19.396 a special edition of the Phantom,
06:46:21.315 left the factory at avalue of about $700,000.
06:46:25.736 However, the customizationsthat Drake made,
06:46:28.322 such as the diamond-encrusted OVO owl
06:46:30.824 in place of the Spirit of Ecstasy,
06:46:32.826 is thought to havebrought the overall price
06:46:34.661 to about $1 million.
06:46:38.749 The most expensive Rolls-Royce model
06:46:40.751 ever built was the Sweptail.
06:46:43.045 The result of over four years' work,
06:46:45.381 this one-of-a-kind car was reported
06:46:47.508 to cost $13 million,
06:46:49.718 previously holding the title of
06:46:51.178 the world's most expensive new car.
06:46:54.306 But while other top-end car manufacturers
06:46:56.350 focus on speed, maneuverability,
06:46:58.769 and super-lightweight-supercar status,
06:47:01.855 Rolls-Royce cars areexpensive for one reason:
06:47:05.609 luxury.
06:47:09.822 These handmade scissors
06:47:11.240 have been produced in Sheffield, England,
06:47:13.325 for over 100 years.
06:47:15.911 But compared to a $2 mass-produced pair,
06:47:18.622 the kitchen scissorswill cost you over $100,
06:47:21.834 and a pair of professionaltailor's shears cost $315.
06:47:26.255 So just what is it thatmakes them so expensive?
06:47:40.060 Cliff Denton is one of just two
06:47:42.062 master putter-togetherers left.
06:47:45.023 Both in their 70s,
06:47:46.400 the masters are theonly ones skilled enough
06:47:48.569 to undertake the finaldelicate part of the process:
06:47:51.697 the assembly of these scissors,
06:47:53.490 or putting together.
06:47:56.118 Cliff Denton: When I wereyoung, every street corner
06:47:58.454 had a little shop withmasters in and working.
06:48:01.540 They've gone.
06:48:02.708 You know, at one stage, we were doing,
06:48:04.126 like, 85, 90 different types of scissor.
06:48:10.841 Narrator: In the 1970s, there were 150
06:48:13.302 small-scale scissorworkshops in Sheffield.
06:48:15.679 Now there are just two.
06:48:17.723 And keeping this craft alive relies on
06:48:19.808 training the nextgeneration of apprentices.
06:48:24.021 Denton: You know, it's justgot that light, magic touch.
06:48:27.024 How to hold them, how to stroke them,
06:48:29.443 how to edge them.
06:48:30.986 And this, to instill on young lads,
06:48:34.072 is hard.
06:48:35.407 Because it's not somethingyou can write down
06:48:38.494 and let them read.
06:48:39.870 They've got to actually do it.
06:48:43.665 Narrator: Unlike cheapermass-manufactured scissors,
06:48:46.043 almost all of the work is done by hand.
06:48:49.254 The starting outline of the scissor
06:48:50.756 is hot-drop-forged off-site.
06:48:53.300 This is called a blank,
06:48:55.344 and while it may already have the shape
06:48:56.803 of a very rough pair of scissors,
06:48:58.805 the process has only just begun.
06:49:02.434 The blanks first need to be drilled,
06:49:04.311 counterbored, and tapped.
06:49:06.313 This puts in a hole inthe center of each half
06:49:08.273 and adds a thread to that hole.
06:49:10.651 Once that work is done,
06:49:11.860 the blades have to be ground down.
06:49:15.280 The blank has no blade on it whatsoever,
06:49:17.699 so initial grinding has to be done
06:49:19.243 on a 50-year-old Viotto machine
06:49:21.787 before further refinementsare done by hand.
06:49:25.374 Jonathan: So, if you were to look at a
06:49:27.167 cheap pair of scissors,you'd quickly notice
06:49:30.128 that it's actually astamped-out piece of metal
06:49:33.966 that have just been bolted together
06:49:36.260 and a blade's edge put on them.
06:49:38.804 So, when we grind the inside of the blade,
06:49:42.474 we'll say there are three angles to it.
06:49:45.227 You've got to have a curve
06:49:46.853 from the pinch of thescissor to the point,
06:49:49.147 which means that whenthe blades are together,
06:49:51.316 you should be able to see
06:49:52.776 a gap through the middle.
06:49:55.028 We'll also want to grind in a twist,
06:49:58.365 and then finally, we want to
06:49:59.575 hollow the blade as well.
06:50:01.868 And what that'll give us
06:50:03.120 is a scissor that will only ever touch
06:50:08.417 at the cutting edge.
06:50:11.503 Narrator: Once the blade is on,
06:50:12.754 the rough edges need to be sanded off
06:50:14.756 from the bow, the shanks,and the nail holes.
06:50:18.302 After everything's sanded down,
06:50:20.095 the scissors are sent off to be hardened,
06:50:22.514 turning the soft, workable metal
06:50:24.474 into a hard final product.
06:50:27.019 Then they're put into therumbler for a few hours
06:50:29.229 to be acid-treated before being dried.
06:50:33.025 Rumbling takes off any grind marks
06:50:34.735 on the surface of the metal
06:50:36.153 and prepares them for polishing.
06:50:39.489 Jonathan: We do differenttypes of scissors.
06:50:41.575 If it was our embroidery stalk,
06:50:43.660 then we could work on
06:50:46.663 maybe 500 embroidery stalks
06:50:48.832 over two weeks to a month.
06:50:50.834 However, if we were doing same-size batch,
06:50:53.170 500 13-inch scissors,
06:50:56.256 then we probably wouldn'teven see that within a year.
06:51:00.135 Narrator: The blades are polished by hand
06:51:01.595 to a mirror finish.
06:51:03.430 Then comes the hardest part:
06:51:05.140 Putting together.
06:51:07.184 Traditionally, you would undertake
06:51:08.518 a five-year apprenticeship
06:51:09.895 before you could even sitat the putter's table.
06:51:12.939 Jonathan: I've never had abackground like this before.
06:51:15.317 I went straight into an office
06:51:16.777 right out of university,
06:51:19.071 and I was walking down this street,
06:51:21.907 and I saw a chalkboard that said,
06:51:23.700 "Scissor makers wanted."
06:51:25.619 And I thought I've always wanted
06:51:27.496 to work with my hands,
06:51:28.622 but I've had no trainingin working with my hands.
06:51:30.874 My training began eight months ago,
06:51:32.834 and it doesn't look like it's gonna stop
06:51:36.213 for at least another few years.
06:51:41.468 Narrator: And despite the intricacy,
06:51:43.178 the most important tool isn't anything
06:51:44.971 small and delicate,
06:51:46.264 but a hammer.
06:51:47.474 Denton: And I'm only gonna need to tap.
06:51:52.312 Narrator: The hammer is crucial
06:51:53.355 to aligning the blades correctly.
06:51:57.776 Denton: So....[tapping]
06:52:00.904 Oh, that's better.
06:52:02.572 Narrator: The two scissorparts are screwed into place,
06:52:04.616 and then a perfect curve ishammered onto each blade.
06:52:08.078 This part of the process
06:52:08.995 is the hardest to get right
06:52:10.706 and also the hardest skill to pass on.
06:52:15.252 Jonathan: If he hits thatwith the wrong tension
06:52:17.504 or the wrong angle or in the wrong spot,
06:52:20.507 he will ruin those scissors.
06:52:22.259 So, I've put a scissor blade down,
06:52:24.636 and I've taken a swing at it,
06:52:26.888 and I've just snapped the blade in half.
06:52:31.601 Narrator: Once the twohalves are married together,
06:52:33.520 a final blade will be put on the scissor.
06:52:40.193 Denton: Well, I started in 1959.
06:52:43.071 Roughly the same. Steady, hammers.
06:52:46.074 Other than we had lights hanging over
06:52:48.243 to get more light.
06:52:50.287 You'll learn. You'll never forget.
06:52:52.080 It's up here in a diary.
06:52:53.874 Somebody'll say a scissor,
06:52:55.500 and it just comes up ona projection in me head.
06:52:58.295 Manicure, dissecting, thread clip.
06:53:01.506 All different scissors.
06:53:04.384 Narrator: Sheffield has been home
06:53:05.510 to England's blade-making industry
06:53:07.262 since as far back as the 14th century.
06:53:10.474 It's where stainless steelwas originally invented,
06:53:12.934 and it's a city that's famedfor its cutlery production.
06:53:16.605 Cliff started makingscissors when he was just 15.
06:53:20.942 Denton: When I pick a pair of scissors up,
06:53:22.527 it tells me a story.
06:53:24.112 I can open and shut it.It's tight, it's slack.
06:53:26.990 You can virtually just
06:53:28.116 shove it with the weight of your finger,
06:53:29.701 and it does the job.
06:53:30.994 That's what you're after.
06:53:32.746 Week after week, yearafter year if need be.
06:53:39.836 That's it.
06:53:47.803 Cuban cigars hold a reputation
06:53:49.638 as the world's mostopulent tobacco product.
06:53:53.266 A box of good-quality Habanoscan cost thousands of dollars.
06:53:58.021 Every hand-rolled Cuban cigar goes through
06:54:00.148 about 500 manual tasks from seed to cigar.
06:54:04.194 But over the last 25 years,
06:54:05.904 cigars made in other countries
06:54:07.364 in the Caribbean and Central America
06:54:09.366 have become comparable inquality, consistency, and cost.
06:54:13.537 Worse still for American smokers,
06:54:15.413 your Cuban cigar could be fake.
06:54:18.041 Some experts suggest that up to 95%
06:54:20.460 of all Cuban cigars in theUS are actually counterfeit.
06:54:24.548 So why are Cuban cigars so desirable?
06:54:27.759 And is that why they're so expensive?
06:54:31.012 For more than 200 years,
06:54:32.430 the culture of cigar makingin Cuba hasn't changed.
06:54:36.101 In a process that takes about a year,
06:54:37.894 tobacco leaves are grown, harvested,
06:54:39.855 and hung in drying houses called secaderos
06:54:42.399 before a slow fermentation occurs,
06:54:44.359 which enhances flavor, aroma,and burning characteristics.
06:54:49.281 Each leaf is inspected for its type,
06:54:51.408 appearance, and quality
06:54:52.826 and handed to a torcedor, ahighly skilled cigar roller,
06:54:56.288 greatly respected in Cuban society.
06:55:47.839 Narrator: The heartlandof Cuban cigar production
06:55:49.549 is in Pinar del Río, thewesternmost province of the island,
06:55:52.886 where 70% of premium cigar tobacco
06:55:55.513 used by state-run cigarcompanies is grown.
06:55:58.600 Cuban tobacco growers claimthat the fundamental influence
06:56:01.311 on quality is the region's terroir,
06:56:03.730 the unique environmentalfactors that affect a crop.
06:56:38.640 Narrator: But some cigarconnoisseurs now argue
06:56:40.600 that cigars from countries like Nicaragua
06:56:42.602 and Dominican Republic,
06:56:43.979 which the industry calls New World cigars,
06:56:46.481 have become both desirableand reliable in the market.
06:56:49.901 Mitchell Orchant: The offering has become
06:56:51.987 improved incredibly.
06:56:54.781 The presentations are excellent,the blending is excellent,
06:56:57.242 the construction's excellent.
06:56:58.576 In very general terms, New World cigars
06:57:00.745 are better quality than Havana cigars
06:57:03.373 because they have betterquality-control procedures.
06:57:06.126 Havana have been very much
06:57:08.128 behind the curve on quality control.
06:57:10.130 I would say, on an averagebox of Cuban cigars,
06:57:13.967 25 cigars, it's not unusual to get three
06:57:16.428 that are unacceptable in terms of quality,
06:57:19.264 usually in terms ofconstruction more than blending.
06:57:22.350 Whereas on an average boxof 25 New World cigars,
06:57:26.104 I would expect all 25 tobe absolutely perfect.
06:57:29.691 Narrator: Despite theflaws in quality control,
06:57:31.568 Mitchell, who's an expertin vintage Habanos,
06:57:34.279 still prefers Cuban cigars.
06:57:36.322 Orchant: I would say Ismoke eight Havana cigars
06:57:38.783 to two New World cigars,
06:57:40.326 and I absolutely adore Havana cigars.
06:57:42.787 However, I very much appreciateNew World cigars as well.
06:57:46.332 It's nice to mix it up becausethere really isn't better,
06:57:48.960 there's only different.
06:57:50.295 So, you know, it's not a case of
06:57:52.255 "Cuban cigars are the best."
06:57:53.590 They're the best for me;
06:57:54.507 they're the best for a lot of people.
06:57:56.176 But 40% of our customers, thebest is New World for them.
06:57:59.763 So it's just personal preference.
06:58:02.223 Narrator: In addition to quality,
06:58:03.266 there are a few fundamental factors
06:58:04.976 that determine the price of all cigars.
06:58:07.729 Firstly, the size,
06:58:09.314 measured in both length and diameter.
06:58:11.441 Generally speaking, the larger the cigar,
06:58:13.526 the more expensive it is.
06:58:15.528 Secondly, the vitola,differently shaped cigars
06:58:18.490 which take extra time andconsideration when rolling.
06:58:22.118 Thirdly, the age.
06:58:24.162 The longer a cigar hasaged, intensifying the depth
06:58:26.831 of flavor and aroma, themore precious it becomes.
06:58:30.668 But lastly, and mostimportantly, is the branding.
06:58:34.506 Habanos is the corporation,
06:58:36.007 part-owned by the Cuban government,
06:58:37.884 that controls theworldwide commercialization
06:58:40.261 of all Habanos cigar brands.
06:58:43.098 All Habanos cigars are made in Cuba,
06:58:45.183 but not every Cuban cigarqualifies as a Habano.
06:58:49.020 The state-owned company issues
06:58:50.480 Protected Denomination of Origin approval
06:58:52.649 for a selection of brandswhose cigars it claims
06:58:55.318 are manufactured to the most stringent
06:58:57.153 quality-control standards.
06:58:59.823 To protect against counterfeiting,
06:59:01.616 Habanos only exports to selectedcompanies in each country.
06:59:06.162 The only nation it does notsell to is the United States,
06:59:09.707 which hasn't allowed theimport of Cuban cigars
06:59:12.001 since the 1962 embargo
06:59:13.878 actioned by President John F. Kennedy,
06:59:15.880 who just hours before signing the decree
06:59:17.882 banning all Cuban productsfrom the United States
06:59:20.468 ordered his press secretary tobuy over 1,000 Cuban cigars.
06:59:25.348 Not only did this ban increase the desire
06:59:27.392 for authentic Cuban cigarsfor American smokers,
06:59:30.270 but it also created a booming black market
06:59:32.355 for smuggled and counterfeit cigars.
06:59:35.150 Orchant: There's just somany fakes around in the US.
06:59:37.610 You can't buy Cuban cigars
06:59:39.946 and get them shipped into America.
06:59:41.698 It's illegal for the Americans.
06:59:43.616 And therefore, I don't know
06:59:45.326 where they're buyingfrom, unscrupulous people.
06:59:47.787 Maybe the fake situationhas declined a little bit
06:59:51.875 since Obama opened upthat you could travel,
06:59:55.378 purchase Cuban cigars, andbring them in personally
06:59:58.298 if you've been on a holidaysomewhere, you know,
07:00:00.341 I think you could bringin up to $800, I think.
07:00:02.719 And above that you canbring in whatever you want
07:00:05.263 and pay a very small amount of duty.
07:00:07.682 So it may have improved slightly,
07:00:10.226 but I would say probably 95% of the cigars
07:00:13.146 that are supposed to be Cubancigars that I've observed,
07:00:16.357 quite simply are very bad fakes.
07:00:18.902 Narrator: Despite being the only country
07:00:20.445 that cannot legallyimport Cuban varieties,
07:00:22.906 the US is still the topcigar-consuming country,
07:00:25.700 by a considerable margin.
07:00:27.994 The cigar industry has grownsubstantially worldwide
07:00:30.371 in the last 20 years, andresearch has previously predicted
07:00:33.750 the market would reach$21 billion by 2025.
07:00:38.296 But cigar traders have long questioned
07:00:39.797 Cuba's supply capabilities,
07:00:41.799 an issue made even more problematic
07:00:43.426 amidst a global pandemic.
07:00:45.511 Orchant: Can Cuba continue to supply
07:00:47.972 as much as we need to feedthe demand of our customers,
07:00:51.684 from agricultural problemsto shipping issues
07:00:54.437 recently due to coronavirus slowing down
07:00:57.273 all the shipping lanes?
07:00:58.650 Will that ultimately feedthrough to the market
07:01:00.818 by prices increasingor discounts reducing?
07:01:04.697 That remains to be seen,
07:01:05.949 but I think that's themore likely scenario.
07:01:08.785 Narrator: As with any consumable,
07:01:09.994 taste and enjoyment are subjective.
07:01:12.288 Considering its depictionas a status symbol
07:01:14.207 in society for over a century,
07:01:16.376 it's reasonable to say thatthe allure of Cuban cigars
07:01:19.003 is somewhat based on prestige.
07:01:21.965 And although high prices arefetched for some Habanos,
07:01:25.051 particularly where outlawedin the United States,
07:01:27.595 in recent years allvariety of premium cigar
07:01:30.139 have become uniformly priced.
07:01:32.809 Nonetheless, despitean increasing appetite
07:01:35.061 for cigars from other countries,
07:01:36.980 some connoisseurs will insist that
07:01:38.439 the most authentic smokecomes only from Cuban cigars.
07:01:45.989 Hand woven with the finest materials
07:01:48.157 including wool and silk,a single Persian rug
07:01:51.327 can often take years andsometimes decades to create.
07:01:55.540 A high-quality Iranian carpet can cost
07:01:57.625 tens of thousands of dollars,
07:01:59.502 with antique rugs fetchingeven higher prices.
07:02:02.839 So, how are Persian rugs made,
07:02:04.590 and why are they so expensive?
07:02:08.803 Although several countries
07:02:09.929 are associated withthe term "Persian rug,"
07:02:12.390 authentic Persian carpetsand the traditional methods
07:02:15.184 of producing them originate in Iran.
07:02:18.062 Every Persian rug isregarded as a piece of art
07:02:20.773 which reflects the historyand culture of Iran.
07:02:24.235 There are many varietiesof Persian carpet,
07:02:26.612 each distinguished by their materials,
07:02:28.656 patterns, and weaving techniques,
07:02:30.825 from the floral designsof Isfahan in central Iran
07:02:33.953 to the intricate, finedetails of Qom carpets
07:02:36.873 and the strong, compact Bidjar rugs
07:02:39.292 from the Western Kurdish village.
07:02:41.711 Gabbeh rugs, made in the Farsprovince of southwestern Iran,
07:02:44.922 are perhaps the most traditional carpets,
07:02:47.133 characterized by their bold designs.
07:03:12.909 Narrator: Traditionally,Persian rugs are made
07:03:14.494 from sheep's wool,
07:03:15.370 which is boiled, spun, and dyed by hand.
07:03:18.623 These bright and elaborate yarns are dyed
07:03:20.541 with natural coloringsfrom plants and insects.
07:03:23.669 In many regions, such asYazd, hundreds of weavers
07:03:26.798 may work in the samefactory at any given time.
07:03:30.093 However, here in Fars Province,
07:03:32.053 where carpet weaving isrecognized as part of
07:03:34.013 the UNESCO IntangibleCultural Heritage list,
07:03:36.599 the materials aredistributed to small villages
07:03:39.102 for tribal women to weave in their homes.
07:04:20.309 Narrator: The processof weaving a Persian rug
07:04:22.186 differs slightly with each variety,
07:04:24.188 but generally speaking,
07:04:25.690 a bed of foundation material called warp
07:04:28.025 is installed into theframe, called the loom.
07:04:31.070 Starting at the bottom,
07:04:32.321 weavers then feed woolin between the warp,
07:04:34.574 tying knots called weft on each one.
07:04:38.119 A highly detailed silk rug can have
07:04:39.996 over 1,000 knots per square inch.
07:04:42.582 However, most carpets are notvalued based on knot count,
07:04:45.668 but rather their materials,design, and overall size.
07:05:33.841 Narrator: While somevarieties of Persian rugs
07:05:35.510 follow design specifications,
07:05:37.553 gabbeh carpets are oftencompletely improvised,
07:05:40.348 with the weaver adding traditional motifs,
07:05:42.517 such as goats, trees, and dolls.
07:06:21.013 Narrator: The origin of these rugs
07:06:22.390 dates back at least 2,500 years ago
07:06:25.142 during the reign of the Persian Empire,
07:06:27.186 which spanned across neighboring countries
07:06:29.063 including what is now known as Turkey.
07:06:32.191 The legacy and tradition of carpet making
07:06:33.985 still remains there.
07:06:35.570 In fact, in 2018, Turkey exported
07:06:37.989 $1.9 billion of hand-wovencarpets worldwide,
07:06:41.867 far higher than Iran'stotal of $35 million.
07:06:46.038 As such, Turkish carpetscan sometimes be regarded
07:06:48.833 as authentic Persian rugs.
07:06:51.836 The most expensive Persian rug ever bought
07:06:54.255 was a 17th-centuryPersian vase-style carpet,
07:06:57.508 which sold at auctionin June 2013 in London
07:07:00.886 for $33.8 million.
07:07:04.599 But despite Iran's rich history
07:07:06.434 of producing handmade rugs,
07:07:08.019 the tribal rugs produced in rural villages
07:07:10.521 could be under threat from alack of young weaving talent.
07:08:24.845 When Doc Martens first appeared in the UK,
07:08:27.139 in 1960, they were working boots
07:08:29.934 that would cost you under $3 a pair.
07:08:33.145 These days, a pair ofMade in England boots
07:08:35.356 could set you back $225.
07:08:38.526 So, what has changed?
07:08:39.944 And why are these shoes now so expensive?
07:08:49.620 Doc Martens are a style icon
07:08:51.455 that has endured for over 50 years.
07:08:54.166 They've been worn by everyonefrom Kanye West and Cardi B
07:08:57.795 to the Dalai Lama andeven Pope John Paul II,
07:09:01.006 when the Vatican placedan order for the famous
07:09:03.300 eight-eyelet boot in black,white, and navy leather.
07:09:07.680 While a pair of Docs may not be
07:09:09.348 the most expensive boot out there,
07:09:11.267 their price and use has gone through
07:09:13.227 a pretty radical transformation.
07:09:15.604 And the company producing themhas shifted dramatically too,
07:09:19.150 from a family-owned local factory
07:09:21.110 to an international fashion brand
07:09:22.862 owned by a private-equity firm.
07:09:24.572 Since 2014, the price ofboots has risen by almost 25%.
07:09:29.201 Sales have grown year and year,
07:09:30.786 and profits were up 70% in 2018 to '19.
07:09:34.915 So how did the company gofrom its humble beginnings
07:09:37.376 to producing 7 million pairs
07:09:39.170 of these shoes each year?
07:09:41.422 Before they got their punk image,
07:09:43.132 Doc Martens weren't quite so cool.
07:09:45.885 The patented technology behind the boots,
07:09:48.095 the air-cushioned sole,was invented in 1945
07:09:51.599 by Dr. Klaus Maertens,a German army doctor
07:09:55.269 who injured his ankle in a skiing accident
07:09:57.813 and was looking for acomfortable alternative
07:09:59.774 to hard leather-sole boots.
07:10:01.984 The market for this new shoe technology
07:10:04.278 wasn't the punks orskinheads you might associate
07:10:06.655 with the history of these shoes,
07:10:08.240 but older women in need of comfortable
07:10:10.242 and practical footwear.
07:10:12.286 They were even advertised as
07:10:13.496 perfect gardening shoes at one point.
07:10:15.998 It was when thistechnology was brought over
07:10:17.792 to the UK in 1960 that the iconic shoe
07:10:20.795 you might recognize was first made.
07:10:23.297 The air-cushioned sole was licensed
07:10:24.840 to the Griggs company in Northampton,
07:10:27.009 and the 1460 boot was created.
07:10:30.429 The iconic stitching andrecognizable heel loop were added,
07:10:33.849 and the boots were sold tofactory workers across England.
07:10:37.728 At the time, these bootscost only $3 a pair.
07:10:40.898 Even with inflation, that's just over $50.
07:10:43.943 They were cheap, hard-wearing,and perfect for postmen,
07:10:47.029 policemen, and workerson their feet all day.
07:10:50.908 The boot was quickly adopted by
07:10:52.368 any counterculturalmovement that appeared,
07:10:54.787 and they became a mainstayin glam, punk, skinhead,
07:10:57.540 ska, and goth style, among many others.
07:11:01.001 Doc Martens' fashion status
07:11:02.378 wasn't always guaranteed, though.
07:11:04.630 After the boom in the '90s,
07:11:06.006 the boots dipped out of fashion,and the company struggled,
07:11:09.218 almost going bust in the early 2000s.
07:11:12.263 As the industry shrank,the cost of manufacturing
07:11:14.557 shoes in England also got more expensive.
07:11:17.059 And by 2002 it already cost
07:11:19.103 around $87 for a pair of Doc Martens.
07:11:22.106 That's around $140 with inflation.
07:11:26.569 Northamptonshire was once the home
07:11:27.945 of shoemaking in England.
07:11:29.613 In the mid-19th century there were
07:11:31.156 over 2,000 shoemakersworking in the region.
07:11:33.993 But as many of these shoemakers struggled,
07:11:35.828 the majority went under ormoved production abroad,
07:11:38.789 and now there are just over 30 left.
07:11:41.917 Doc Martens followed suit,moving their production to Asia.
07:11:45.921 The company still makes shoes
07:11:47.256 in its Northamptonshire factory,
07:11:48.924 but now this is only around2% of its total production.
07:11:52.928 Doc Martens says this relocation
07:11:54.763 hasn't changed the wayits shoes are made at all.
07:11:57.558 We wanted to see if thereactually was a difference
07:11:59.727 between the new Asian-made boots,
07:12:01.729 the more expensive Madein England variety,
07:12:03.939 or a vintage pair from before the move.
07:12:06.275 We spoke to someone who's torn down
07:12:07.693 multiple pairs of these shoes to find out.
07:12:11.196 I'm Weston Kay, I'm aprofessional leatherworker,
07:12:13.324 and I cut boots andshoes in half on YouTube.
07:12:16.869 Yeah, I would say the production methods
07:12:18.037 are really similar betweenthe Asian-made boots
07:12:19.788 and the Made in England boots.
07:12:22.124 A lot of the same features on the inside
07:12:24.293 of how they stich theirboots are identical.
07:12:27.129 Their construction's really similar.
07:12:28.505 They still heat-sew the sole to the welt.
07:12:32.468 I think a lot of thebig differences between
07:12:34.345 the vintage boots and the newer ones,
07:12:36.805 it's stuff that you would only notice
07:12:39.016 if you cut it in half, almost,
07:12:40.809 or if you wore them for long enough time.
07:12:42.895 The vintage Doc Martenshad a way better midsole
07:12:46.440 that adds a lot of comfort,they had a wooden shank,
07:12:48.692 and the leather was just a lot better.
07:12:50.194 So they lasted longer,they're more comfortable,
07:12:51.987 they have the support you need.
07:12:53.697 The newer ones just have worse versions
07:12:55.991 of the old ones' materials.
07:12:58.327 I wouldn't describethem as a super-durable
07:13:00.245 or long-lasting boot, but a lot of people
07:13:02.206 are just buying these boots
07:13:03.040 because they're Doc Martens anyway.
07:13:04.375 And they're gonna be comfortable,
07:13:05.751 they're gonna last a decently long time,
07:13:07.711 so most people are gonnabe happy with them.
07:13:10.255 Narrator: We contacted DocMartens about these comments.
07:13:12.633 And their spokesperson told us:
07:13:46.792 Regardless of the materials,Doc Martens' style has endured.
07:13:51.005 And since 2002, the brand'spopularity has skyrocketed.
07:13:55.551 The countercultural imagethat made it so famous
07:13:58.012 is something that has stuck to this day,
07:14:00.222 despite the expansion from small-town
07:14:02.182 British-made boot to international icon.
07:14:05.853 And for fans of the boot,this can be an obsession.
07:14:11.942 Over the years, the company's evolved
07:14:13.694 from producing one boot in 1960
07:14:16.196 to producing around 250 styles each year.
07:14:20.075 And as its popularity hasgrown, so has the competition.
07:14:23.746 Over recent years, DocMartens has filed lawsuits
07:14:26.081 against Urban Outfitters,Vans, Boohoo, and others
07:14:29.418 in an attempt to protectits iconic boot design.
07:14:32.921 In 2014, the companywas sold by the family
07:14:35.966 and bought by private-equity firm Permira.
07:14:39.178 Since this takeover, the price of boots
07:14:41.180 has risen by almost 25%,
07:14:43.849 and profits were up 70% in 2018 to '19,
07:14:47.770 in large part due to the newfound success
07:14:49.813 of their vegan range.
07:14:51.648 And while the boots have transitioned from
07:14:53.067 an English worker's bootinto a global fashion icon,
07:14:56.236 their style has endured,
07:14:57.738 and their devoted fanfollowing isn't going anywhere.
07:15:04.578 This sea salt could cost you
07:15:05.871 more than 30 times theprice of table salt.
07:15:09.458 Unlike the cheap salt that'smined across the world,
07:15:12.211 this salt is all harvested by hand
07:15:14.588 in one remote region inthe Northwest of Iceland.
07:15:18.383 So just what makes it so expensive?
07:15:22.429 This is Saltverk.
07:15:24.056 It's a sea salt factory inthe Westfjords of Iceland.
07:15:27.893 Housed in one of the most remote
07:15:29.520 and coldest locations in the country,
07:15:31.563 it produces 10 metrictons of salt each year.
07:15:35.734 The salt takes at least a week to make,
07:15:37.611 and almost all of thework is done by hand.
07:15:41.073 But there's one other thing that's unique
07:15:42.658 about the way that it's processed.
07:15:44.743 Everything is poweredentirely by geothermal energy.
07:15:48.038 Petar Stakic: We use thegeothermal energy that we have
07:15:49.915 available here in the Reykjanes Peninsula,
07:15:51.917 which are one of the purestseawaters in the world.
07:15:54.294 We are moving the water from the fjord
07:15:56.672 into the big buildinghere that we have outside.
07:15:59.258 In each pool we have radiators.
07:16:02.219 Through the radiators, thehot water from the spring
07:16:05.180 circulates and heats up the seawater.
07:16:07.558 And as the water fromthe seawater evaporates,
07:16:10.602 the concentration of salt gets higher.
07:16:13.105 The tanks are run on hot water.
07:16:15.524 The pans are run on hot water.
07:16:16.984 The drying room is on hot water.
07:16:18.402 The heating for thefactory, for the houses,
07:16:21.321 everything is run on hot water.
07:16:23.407 It is green as it gets.
07:16:26.493 Narrator: The process ofmaking sea salt is simple,
07:16:28.871 but it takes a lot of work.
07:16:31.248 Salt is made by heatingseawater to evaporate the water
07:16:34.334 and increase the salt level.
07:16:36.461 Sea salt has been produced likethis for thousands of years.
07:16:40.340 Water pumped directly from the sea
07:16:41.967 is naturally about 3.5% salt,
07:16:44.761 but it needs to reach about 26%
07:16:47.055 before the water is saturatedand salt begins to form.
07:16:50.809 The water is first preheated
07:16:52.269 until it reaches a salinitylevel of about 20%.
07:16:55.856 Stakic: The whole processof making salt here
07:16:58.609 takes, from sea to salt,from seven to 10 days,
07:17:03.030 depending on the weatherand the time of the year.
07:17:06.283 We get better results in the wintertime
07:17:09.411 because of the lower humidity,
07:17:10.996 because the frost takes out the humidity.
07:17:13.207 And it's harder in thesummertime. As you can see,
07:17:15.918 we have a really high humidity and rain.
07:17:19.129 So it's really hard toevaporate, because this,
07:17:21.798 Iceland, is not a placewhere you usually make salt.
07:17:25.969 Narrator: Once it's reached this point,
07:17:27.095 it's moved to large pans and boiled.
07:17:29.640 When the water hits 26% salinity,
07:17:32.142 it becomes completely saturated
07:17:34.061 and salt crystals startto form on the surface.
07:17:37.147 These crystals slowly sinkto the bottom of the pans,
07:17:39.775 where they're drawn and drainedof any remaining liquid.
07:17:43.278 The salt is spread evenly on drying trays
07:17:45.364 and moved to a large ovento dry for over 12 hours
07:17:48.742 before being sifted and packaged for sale.
07:17:52.829 Salt has been an importantpart of Icelandic cuisine
07:17:55.249 for hundreds of years,
07:17:56.708 and many treated it as a currency.
07:18:00.254 Although sourcing salt isn'tquite so hard these days,
07:18:02.923 the tradition of saltmaking still remains.
07:18:05.676 Stakic: During the 17thcentury, the Danish king
07:18:08.136 had his salt-makingfactory in this region,
07:18:10.973 and he was also producing salt here.
07:18:14.351 And it was an important partfor the economy of the island,
07:18:17.771 as it was used for preserving food
07:18:19.940 over the long winter months
07:18:21.525 and also for export of fish and cod.
07:18:25.654 In those times also, it wasconsidered as valuable as gold.
07:18:29.157 There was a law introducedhere in the 17th century
07:18:32.202 stating that people, whileworking as salt makers,
07:18:36.456 were prohibited of having wife
07:18:38.625 or children or a family,
07:18:41.712 because it was seen asa distraction from work.
07:18:44.756 It just shows howimportant it was to them.
07:18:50.178 Narrator: The final result isa very minimally processed,
07:18:52.681 flaky sea salt fromclear Icelandic waters.
07:18:56.393 Unlike processed rock salt,
07:18:57.728 the sea minerals remain in the crystals,
07:18:59.688 but these are only a tinypercentage of the final product.
07:19:03.317 Producing any product insuch a remote location
07:19:05.902 has its difficulties, whichcontributes to the price.
07:19:09.239 But with Saltverk featuring exclusively
07:19:11.283 at some of the world's best restaurants
07:19:13.285 and their production processleaving a 0% carbon footprint,
07:19:16.872 consumers will continue to pay top dollar
07:19:19.082 for pure Icelandic sea salt.
07:19:22.711 This spacesuit, built in 1974,
07:19:25.505 was reported to cost between
07:19:27.049 $15 million and $22 million.
07:19:30.385 Today, that would be about $150 million.
07:19:34.473 Having not delivered any new mission-ready
07:19:37.017 extravehicular suits since then,
07:19:39.019 NASA is running out of spacesuits.
07:19:41.646 In fact, NASA are down to just four
07:19:44.274 flight-ready EVA suits.
07:19:46.610 Since 2009, NASA has invested more than
07:19:49.488 $200 million in spacesuit development,
07:19:52.657 recently unveiling the xEMU prototype.
07:19:56.328 But NASA still does not havea new fleet of spacesuits.
07:20:00.457 So why has it taken so long
07:20:02.209 for new spacesuits to be built?
07:20:03.919 And what makes them so expensive?
07:20:06.296 Cathleen Lewis: Spacesuitsare so expensive because
07:20:08.131 they're complex, human-shaped spacecraft.
07:20:11.676 Think about them in terms of spacecraft,
07:20:13.845 not as work clothes.
07:20:15.222 A spacesuit has to protect an astronaut
07:20:17.641 from the vacuum of space,
07:20:19.476 from radiation coming fromthe sun and other bodies,
07:20:22.521 and it has to protect againstfast-traveling particles
07:20:26.066 that are traveling upto 18,000 miles an hour
07:20:29.194 that could penetrate the suit.
07:20:30.779 They provide oxygen,communications, telemetry,
07:20:35.075 and everything else thata human needs to survive,
07:20:38.245 all rolled into one tiny,human-formed spacecraft.
07:20:42.207 Narrator: But the spacesuitsNASA currently uses
07:20:44.626 are more than 40 years old.
07:20:47.379 18 suits were developed forthe Space Shuttle program
07:20:50.298 in 1974 and have vastly overworked
07:20:53.760 their original 15-year-life design.
07:20:56.930 Suit No. 1 was onlyused for certification,
07:21:00.225 while suit two was destroyedduring ground testing.
07:21:03.270 Two suits were lost in theChallenger disaster in 1986,
07:21:07.149 and another two in theColumbia disaster in 2003.
07:21:10.861 The most recent spacesuitloss was unit 17,
07:21:14.030 during SpaceX-7's cargo-mission mishap.
07:21:19.536 The exact cost to replacethis unit is unknown,
07:21:22.581 but estimates range ashigh as $250 million.
07:21:26.626 For the remaining 11 suits,the damage is mounting,
07:21:29.754 with seven in various stages
07:21:31.506 of refurbishment and maintenance.
07:21:33.967 That leaves only fourflight-ready spacesuits
07:21:36.636 aboard the International Space Station.
07:21:38.847 In fact, NASA's first all-female spacewalk
07:21:42.058 was postponed because the space station
07:21:44.311 had only one medium-sized suit.
07:21:47.147 This milestone was finally achieved
07:21:49.274 when NASA sent up a medium-torso shell
07:21:51.818 to fit the existing larger suit.
07:21:55.113 NASA has invested about aquarter of a billion dollars
07:21:58.116 developing the xEMU suitfor its Artemis program,
07:22:02.078 which plans to take humansback to the surface of the moon
07:22:05.081 by 2024, with a view toeventually go to Mars.
07:22:09.628 With that goal fast approaching
07:22:11.463 and the number of existingspacesuits dwindling,
07:22:14.132 NASA engineers face anew kind of space race.
07:22:17.427 Jesse Buffington: There isabsolutely a sense of urgency,
07:22:19.763 not only because of the number of suits
07:22:21.973 itself is relatively small,
07:22:23.975 but the individual components that we use
07:22:26.311 to keep the suits healthyand moving forward
07:22:28.605 is also dwindling.
07:22:29.898 A great example of that
07:22:31.858 is the carbon dioxide sensors.
07:22:33.527 The design that the current suits fly
07:22:36.321 is a heritage design,some of the components
07:22:38.657 of which are no longer produced.
07:22:40.075 Some of the vendors that made
07:22:41.243 those components no longer even exist.
07:22:43.411 And so today the CO2sensor is a great example
07:22:46.623 of a component where a replacement design
07:22:49.417 that will work for both theexisting suit and the new suit
07:22:52.837 basically would be a drop-in replacement
07:22:54.256 that's compatible with both suit designs.
07:22:57.509 Narrator: These people-shaped spacecraft
07:22:59.511 are packed with complex components.
07:23:01.888 But the most expensiveparts are subject to debate.
07:23:05.559 Lewis: The most expensive component
07:23:07.435 of the spacesuit are the gloves.
07:23:09.563 The gloves are the most complex because
07:23:11.356 the astronauts need themfor manual dexterity
07:23:14.985 to do meaningful work in space.
07:23:17.070 You see the interior, yousee a system of pulleys
07:23:19.906 and strings that hold it together.
07:23:22.492 And then, on the outside of the glove,
07:23:24.661 you see the system of heat radiators
07:23:27.539 that allow the astronautto keep their hands warm.
07:23:30.834 Buffington: The gloves are an amazing
07:23:32.836 and intricate component,but at the end of the day,
07:23:35.255 the pressure garment,including the gloves,
07:23:37.465 is actually less expensivethan the life-support system.
07:23:40.677 The backpack that is wornon the back of the suit
07:23:43.805 is a highly compressed set of technologies
07:23:47.726 that do everything frommaintain temperature
07:23:49.978 to remove carbon dioxide
07:23:51.813 and continue to provide pressure
07:23:54.065 inside the suit itself,
07:23:55.358 and I think, in the end,several of those components
07:23:58.361 are each more expensive than most of
07:24:00.739 the other garmentcomponents, like the gloves.
07:24:03.617 Narrator: But even theseexpertly engineered
07:24:05.452 suits can go wrong.
07:24:07.370 In 2013, European Space Agencyastronaut Luca Parmitano
07:24:12.125 reported that his helmetstarted filling with water.
07:24:15.211 Chris Cassidy: That stuff onyour forehead is not sweat?
07:24:17.297 Luca Parmitano: No, it's not.Cassidy: Oh, I see what....
07:24:19.215 Crew member: Catch coming open.
07:24:20.300 Crew member: Copy all,Chris. If you could have some
07:24:21.635 towels ready, that would be great.
07:24:24.137 Narrator: In total, almost1 1/2 liters of water
07:24:26.973 leaked into his helmet,
07:24:28.683 threatening to drownParmitano mid-spacewalk.
07:24:33.188 But considering that NASA'sApollo-era spacesuits
07:24:35.982 allowed 12 humans to walkon the moon 50 years ago
07:24:39.611 and considering theSpace Shuttle-era suits
07:24:41.821 have been used on over 200 spacewalks,
07:24:44.491 is such a large investmentin new spacesuits needed?
07:24:48.370 Lewis: Well, that dependson what you're going
07:24:50.664 to ask the astronauts to do.
07:24:52.457 Walking on Mars is differentfrom walking on the moon.
07:24:55.460 It's a different environment;it has different hazards.
07:24:58.546 So when you're picking theseassignments for astronauts,
07:25:02.342 you have to take into account,
07:25:04.135 do you want the astronautto be able to walk,
07:25:05.970 bend over, pick up things,
07:25:07.931 or will he or she be carrying something?
07:25:10.809 So you have all those considerations
07:25:12.602 that have to fold into that design.
07:25:14.938 Buffington: We believe it is a necessity.
07:25:16.564 Some of the components andsome of the design concepts
07:25:20.318 are no longer consistent
07:25:22.612 with our values and expectations
07:25:25.281 in terms of the quantity and distribution
07:25:27.534 of crew members that we fit.
07:25:29.327 I believe that, yes, the investment
07:25:30.912 is appropriate and worthwhile.
07:25:32.872 All those dollars getspent here on the ground,
07:25:35.458 and they are returned to us in ways that
07:25:37.961 ultimately yield benefitsfor all of humanity
07:25:40.547 and for the taxpayershere in this country.
07:25:42.590 We are also lowering the barriers to entry
07:25:45.635 from a commercial perspective.
07:25:46.928 Getting more companies involved,
07:25:48.471 getting more companiescompeting and innovating
07:25:50.473 to try to continue to reduce that price.
07:25:54.102 Narrator: In an effort to develop
07:25:55.228 technology at lower costs,
07:25:57.063 NASA often sets designchallenges for innovation,
07:26:00.483 sometimes partnering with the designers
07:26:02.444 and companies who impress the most.
07:26:05.321 In the 2009 Astronaut Glove Challenge,
07:26:08.366 Ted Southern bagged the second-place prize
07:26:10.618 of $100,000.
07:26:12.829 He and his partner, Nikolay Moiseev,
07:26:15.331 a leading Russian spacesuit engineer,
07:26:17.417 used their winnings toform Final Frontier Design.
07:26:20.879 Ted Southern: We as a business were formed
07:26:22.255 about 10 years ago, andhave worked with NASA
07:26:25.300 on components of EVAsuits for that whole time.
07:26:28.136 NASA is our biggest customer,
07:26:29.471 and we've delivered prototype components
07:26:31.639 for the suit, including the glove, elbow,
07:26:34.309 shoulder assemblies, parts, and pieces.
07:26:36.311 But just over the last two years,
07:26:37.896 we've focused on bringingthe whole system together.
07:26:41.900 Narrator: And FinalFrontier plans to build
07:26:43.651 its own EVA suit much,much cheaper than NASA's.
07:26:47.739 Southern: We intend todeliver flight-level suits
07:26:51.409 with similar requirements as NASA's.
07:26:54.120 Our suits are made with the same material
07:26:55.997 as the suits that NASAuse down to the mil.
07:26:58.833 Traditionally, spacesuitsare very expensive.
07:27:02.086 I expect our suit development
07:27:04.589 will be in the multimillion-dollar range,
07:27:07.133 but I hope that our suit EVA system
07:27:09.594 will be around $2 million apiece or less.
07:27:13.515 Narrator: Even though NASAhas not officially released
07:27:15.558 the unit price of the new xEMU suit,
07:27:18.895 it's safe to say theircosts will be much higher.
07:27:21.856 Buffington: If we were to take the design
07:27:23.107 of the suit we have today,
07:27:24.943 if we were to reproducecopies of that suit,
07:27:27.320 we believe that would cost us in the range
07:27:28.905 of $15 million to $25 million per unit.
07:27:31.282 But we do believe that the design
07:27:32.867 that we're developing today with the xEMU
07:27:35.286 should not only stay within that range,
07:27:37.163 we actually believe that competition
07:27:38.581 and the innovation that we fostered
07:27:40.083 will actually drive thatcost lower per unit.
07:27:43.837 Narrator: How does NASA's spacesuit costs
07:27:45.839 compare with other countries?
07:27:47.632 Russia's equivalent of theEMU suit is called the Orlan.
07:27:51.427 Like NASA, it also has four suits
07:27:53.680 aboard the space station.
07:27:55.139 But it also has reserves,
07:27:57.267 both at the Cosmonaut TrainingCenter in Star City, Russia,
07:28:01.020 and at Johnson SpaceCenter in Houston, Texas.
07:28:04.607 According to Nikolay Moiseev,
07:28:06.150 who is one of the fewengineers to work on both
07:28:08.319 America's EMU and Russia'sOrlan, unlike NASA,
07:28:12.490 Roscosmos has continually developed
07:28:14.617 new generations of spacesuits.
07:28:16.953 Moiseev personallyparticipated in the development
07:28:19.581 of five generations of Russian spacesuits
07:28:22.667 and estimates that 24 units were made
07:28:24.836 between 1997 and 2002,
07:28:27.797 with a further 24 unitsmade between 2002 and 2019.
07:28:32.760 Roscosmos is alsodeveloping a new EVA suit
07:28:36.306 for Russia's first proposedmoon landing, by 2030.
07:28:40.727 With Russian technology in acycle of constant development
07:28:44.147 and American EMU fleets continuing to age,
07:28:47.358 more commercial opportunitiescould become available
07:28:49.944 for private companies like Final Frontier
07:28:52.655 to develop spacesuittechnologies at lower prices.
07:28:56.034 In 2017, Elon Musk revealedthe SpaceX IVA spacesuit.
07:29:01.748 Although this intravehicular suit
07:29:03.458 is only for use inside the spacecraft,
07:29:06.377 its 3D-printed helmetand custom-made garments
07:29:09.464 are a glimpse into the futureof commercial space wear.
07:29:12.508 But is there an actual needfor cheaper spacesuits,
07:29:15.345 or is space explorationunavoidably expensive?
07:29:18.556 Southern: I believe the worldneeds cheaper spacesuits
07:29:21.100 because in my opinion it's inevitable
07:29:23.728 that we will expand pastthe surface of the Earth.
07:29:27.190 We need to take advantageof the resources of space
07:29:31.319 to keep our planet healthy and alive.
07:29:34.656 So, whether it's spacesuitsor rocket technology
07:29:38.201 or means of living inmicrogravity, all of these things
07:29:41.663 I think are important forthe future of humanity.
07:29:46.751 Neil Armstrong [altered]:That's one small step for man,
07:29:49.796 one giant cost for NASA.
07:29:55.927 Even in the expensive world of spices,
07:29:58.137 saffron stands out.
07:30:00.098 And real saffron can cost youover $10,000 per kilogram.
07:30:05.395 Sought after for thousands of years
07:30:07.063 as a spice, a dye, and a medicine,
07:30:09.691 you need over 150 flowers tomake just 1 gram of saffron.
07:30:13.903 And the stuff you have at home
07:30:14.946 in the cupboard could well be fake.
07:30:17.949 So just what makes thisspice so expensive?
07:30:26.749 Saffron is the red stigmaof the Crocus sativus.
07:30:30.420 Each crocus has three small stigmas
07:30:32.714 that have to be picked carefully by hand.
07:30:35.967 This minuscule harvestmeans that the amount
07:30:38.136 you get from each floweris roughly 0.006 grams.
07:30:42.974 No machine can do thedelicate work required
07:30:45.059 to harvest these thin threads.
07:30:47.437 And it can take 40 hoursof hard manual labor
07:30:49.981 to produce just 1 kilogramof high-quality saffron.
07:30:53.818 Growing the plants isn'texactly easy either.
07:30:57.572 David Smale: They'reactually called corms,
07:30:59.365 but they're like a bulb, basically.
07:31:01.617 Like, you know, a flower bulb.
07:31:03.953 So, the more flowers per bulb you can get,
07:31:05.663 and the bigger the flowers, really,
07:31:06.873 and that all depends onhow you look after it,
07:31:09.751 how you grow it, the climate.
07:31:11.961 So, for example, if itrains just before harvest,
07:31:15.548 we get bigger flowers.
07:31:16.883 If it's very dry just before harvest,
07:31:18.676 the flowers are smaller.
07:31:19.677 So you look after the cropduring the year by hand,
07:31:22.013 and you pick the flowers by hand,
07:31:24.432 and you process the flowers by hand.
07:31:27.769 Narrator: Once the crop starts flowering,
07:31:29.228 harvesters have to work fast
07:31:30.813 to make sure they can pick it all in time.
07:31:33.524 Almost all of the saffron planted
07:31:35.109 can flower within one week of the year.
07:31:37.487 And to maintain the quality,
07:31:38.696 the flowers are best pickedfirst thing in the morning.
07:31:42.575 Quality is key when growingsuch a precise crop.
07:31:45.328 And the taste of the saffron depends on
07:31:46.788 the rainfall, temperature, and soil.
07:31:49.457 Kashmir is famed for producing some of the
07:31:51.209 highest-quality saffron in the world.
07:32:25.159 Narrator: And that small strand of saffron
07:32:26.661 that you harvest as aresult of all of this work?
07:32:29.497 Well, to get the highest grades,
07:32:30.832 you might need to throw half of it away.
07:32:33.751 The most expensive, highest-grade saffron
07:32:35.878 is generally made up of justthe very tips of the stigma.
07:32:39.257 In Iran, where over 90% of theworld's saffron is produced,
07:32:42.343 there are four grades.
07:32:44.345 The lowest grade is the bunch.
07:32:46.055 That's the entire strandthat's pulled from the flower,
07:32:48.349 from the dark red tips to the yellow base.
07:32:51.018 In higher grades, theyellow strand is removed,
07:32:53.938 leaving only a long strand of pure red.
07:32:56.983 That means a kilo ofsaffron could be made up
07:32:58.860 of 450,000 strands.
07:33:01.904 And to get that many strands,
07:33:03.156 you need 150,000 flowers.
07:33:06.659 And those flowers take upa lot of growing space.
07:33:10.079 Cumin, for example, canyield 600 kilos per acre.
07:33:13.708 Nutmeg gets you around 350kilograms in the same space.
07:33:17.253 Use that land for saffron instead,
07:33:19.172 and you get a 1.8 kilogram harvest.
07:33:22.717 Despite the incredible amount of work
07:33:24.302 and space this crop takes up,
07:33:26.179 demand for the spice is increasing,
07:33:28.431 and over 200 metrictons of saffron threads
07:33:30.850 are harvested worldwide each year.
07:33:33.311 That's the result ofabout 30 billion flowers.
07:33:36.981 Demand for the threads is so high
07:33:38.774 that many adulterate orproduce fake saffron.
07:33:41.819 Threads that look real at first glance
07:33:43.529 could actually be made of corn silks,
07:33:45.239 coconut fibers, or even horsehair.
07:33:47.700 Synthetic colorings are also used
07:33:49.160 to dye the lower-gradestigmas and sell them
07:33:51.329 as high-grade saffron.
07:33:53.623 In late 2019, a fake-saffron crime ring
07:33:56.459 was uncovered in the UK,
07:33:57.835 which led to a two-yearinternational investigation.
07:34:00.671 And back in 2010,
07:34:02.632 Spain exported 190,000 kilos of saffron,
07:34:05.718 worth $50 million,
07:34:07.428 but the country's total production
07:34:09.180 amounted to only 1,500 kilos.
07:34:11.766 At the time, a localfarmers union reported
07:34:13.893 that up to 90% of Spanishsaffron exports were fraudulent.
07:34:17.939 The industry has attempted to crack down
07:34:19.690 on these fake and mislabeled products,
07:34:21.859 but the problem still persists,
07:34:23.486 and the market for fake saffron
07:34:24.987 is closing many real saffron farmers down.
07:34:28.241 So, what does real saffronactually taste like?
07:34:31.285 Smale: I've been asked that one by
07:34:33.037 a lot of people over the years. [laughs]
07:34:34.872 It's so difficult to describe,
07:34:36.874 which is, I think, part ofits fascination for people
07:34:39.710 and why it ended up asan expensive product,
07:34:42.755 because it is - it just adds something.
07:34:44.715 It's a bittersweet flavor;
07:34:46.384 it's an earthy flavor.
07:34:47.843 Trying to replicate it is very difficult.
07:34:49.387 And we've - you know, peoplehave tried to do that, I know.
07:34:53.808 Narrator: While saffron isjust as popular as ever,
07:34:55.643 it's been sought after throughout history.
07:34:58.771 In Greek mythology, Zeus sometimes slept
07:35:00.856 on a bed of saffron.
07:35:02.358 And Cleopatra was said tobathe in saffron and milk,
07:35:05.403 using the dyeing properties of the spice
07:35:07.113 as an ancient fake tan.
07:35:09.782 Every culture seems to have its own myth
07:35:11.367 about the spice's powers,
07:35:13.035 and in the 14th century,
07:35:14.412 saffron's popularityskyrocketed across Europe
07:35:17.081 when it was thought to be apossible cure for the plague.
07:35:21.669 But there's a recent looming problem
07:35:23.170 for saffron and its price:
07:35:24.755 climate change.
07:35:26.549 In Kashmir, productionhas dropped significantly,
07:35:29.385 and many farmers areselling their land instead.
07:35:32.221 Sajad Rafeeq: We had,you know, very few rains
07:35:35.349 in the last, I think, four or five years.
07:35:37.852 The temperature and the climate
07:35:39.270 has completely changed in Kashmir.
07:35:41.314 When I was a kid, when we used to go
07:35:43.107 to the saffron farmsto pick up the saffron,
07:35:45.776 it would at least take us two days
07:35:47.820 to pick up the saffronfrom the same fields which,
07:35:50.448 you know, nowadays you couldjust pick up in half an hour.
07:35:53.826 I'm very emotional about the saffron,
07:35:56.829 because this is a culturalidentity of Kashmir
07:35:58.998 and especially the people of Pampore.
07:36:01.083 But the thing is that theproduction is declining,
07:36:04.420 and the lands are being sold.
07:36:07.089 Houses are being builton the saffron land.
07:36:10.009 So it really disheartens me.
07:36:13.804 Narrator: Between 2017 and '18,
07:36:15.890 saffron production in theregion fell almost 70%,
07:36:19.185 from 16.5 metric tons down to 5.2.
07:36:23.272 And with continuingdroughts and climate change,
07:36:25.441 this harvest could become even more rare.
07:36:32.865 Argan oil can cost asmuch as $300 per liter,
07:36:36.660 making it the world'smost expensive edible oil.
07:36:40.664 Just 20 years ago, however,the production of argan oil
07:36:43.709 was isolated to local villages in Morocco,
07:36:46.212 with international salesvirtually nonexistent.
07:36:49.423 But since then, the formationof women-run cooperatives
07:36:52.510 has transformed the production
07:36:54.261 into a billion-dollar industry.
07:36:56.931 So, why has argan oil suddenlygained such popularity?
07:37:00.101 And what makes it so expensive?
07:37:05.022 Argan oil is predominantly used
07:37:06.524 in high-end cosmetic productsand Moroccan cuisine.
07:37:10.361 The oil comes from theseed of the argan tree,
07:37:12.947 native only to the narrowstrip of semi-desert
07:37:15.408 between Morocco's Atlanticcoast and the Atlas Mountains.
07:37:19.412 The Amazigh people of North Africa
07:37:21.455 have been using the arganseeds for centuries,
07:37:24.250 and the methods forcreating this costly oil
07:37:26.627 haven't changed in years.
07:37:57.825 Narrator: Once collected, theargan fruits are sun-dried
07:38:00.494 before being peeled and de-pulped by hand
07:38:03.122 to remove the fleshy outer layers.
07:38:05.624 The leftover argan nutthen needs to be cracked
07:38:08.210 to retrieve the oil-rich kernel inside.
07:38:40.493 Narrator: The next stage is grinding,
07:38:42.161 which is often also done by hand.
07:39:42.388 Narrator: The leftoverpulp removed from the fruit
07:39:44.265 is sold as animal feed,particularly for goats,
07:39:47.226 who are intrinsicallylinked to the argan tree.
07:39:50.563 In some areas, it'stradition to allow goats
07:39:52.731 to climb the trees tofreely feed on the fruits.
07:39:56.235 Argan kernels are thencollected from their excrement,
07:39:59.071 saving the laborious work
07:40:00.489 of cracking open the nuts manually.
07:40:03.200 But nowadays, in most argan forestries,
07:40:05.786 this peculiar sight is mainlyused as a tourist attraction.
07:40:31.729 Narrator: Traditionally, Amazigh women,
07:40:33.480 who until 1956 requiredthe man's permission
07:40:36.609 to leave their homes,
07:40:37.943 made argan oil primarilyfor culinary purposes
07:40:40.904 using methods passeddown through generations.
07:40:44.366 This artisanal oil wasoccasionally sold on the roadside
07:40:47.411 in recycled bottles foras little as $3 per liter.
07:41:04.345 Narrator: Zoubida Charrouf first studied
07:41:06.055 the argan tree for herPhD in the late 1980s,
07:41:09.600 when the species was in dangerous decline.
07:41:12.936 After conducting scientific research
07:41:14.730 to support the moisturizingbenefits of argan oil
07:41:17.107 on hair and skin, Charroufplanned to transform
07:41:20.069 the environmental probleminto an economic solution.
07:42:10.327 Narrator: Sure enough, therapid rise in popularity
07:42:12.496 of argan oil not onlybrought profit to the region,
07:42:15.165 but also revitalized an entire ecosystem.
07:42:18.377 The newfound respect forthe value of argan trees
07:42:20.921 ensured stability forthe species, and in turn,
07:42:23.424 the surrounding wildlife andcommunity reaped the benefits.
07:42:27.678 The argan tree, known locally
07:42:29.263 as "the tree of life,"provides food, shelter,
07:42:32.141 and protection from desertification,
07:42:34.393 and its deep roots prevent soil erosion,
07:42:36.812 allowing vegetated grass togrow for grazing livestock.
07:42:41.108 It's estimated that up to 90%of the economy in this region
07:42:44.486 is owed to the argan tree.
07:43:11.930 Narrator: In just one generation,
07:43:13.307 the international market for argan oil
07:43:15.100 has risen from just 200 liters
07:43:17.144 to 4,000 metric tons in 2019.
07:43:20.689 By 2025, the state's ambition
07:43:23.150 is to sell over 10,000 metric tons.
07:43:26.695 To facilitate this increase,the area for producing the oil
07:43:29.907 has expanded more than 100miles south of Essaouira
07:43:32.785 and is due to expand north.
07:43:35.746 As with any costly ingredient,
07:43:37.414 argan oil products are often adulterated.
07:43:39.917 Both cosmetic and culinaryargan oil is often labeled
07:43:42.795 as "pure" despite theundisclosed percentage
07:43:45.547 of Argania kernel oil being mixed
07:43:47.716 with a host of chemical compounds.
07:43:51.220 And cheaper, mechanically extracted oil
07:43:53.263 has begun to appear on the market
07:43:55.265 for as little as $22 a liter,
07:43:57.684 threatening the stabilityof the local cooperatives.
07:44:00.646 However, some cosmeticgiants, such as L'Oréal,
07:44:03.315 have committed to fair-trade programs
07:44:05.734 to help ensure thestability of their argan oil
07:44:08.320 and the preservation ofthe forest's biodiversity.
07:44:11.824 With the help of the cooperatives,
07:44:13.242 the traditional skillsheld by the Amazigh women
07:44:15.744 have created a booming industry.
07:44:18.288 But even though this income has granted
07:44:19.915 some financial independencein a male-dominated society,
07:44:23.669 the women normally makeless than $220 a month -
07:44:26.964 below Morocco's recommendednational minimum wage.
07:44:31.426 With the argan oil industry predicted
07:44:33.053 to continue its growth,
07:44:34.513 the prosperity of the Amazighwomen remains to be seen.
07:44:42.187 Real eiderdown is one of the warmest
07:44:44.022 natural fibers you can find,
07:44:45.816 but it doesn't come cheap.
07:44:47.693 And an eiderdown double duvet
07:44:49.319 could cost you over $8,000.
07:44:53.073 Harvested from the nest of eider ducks
07:44:54.908 found wild in Iceland, collecting a kilo
07:44:57.536 of this fluffy material isn't easy,
07:45:00.080 and only 4 metric tons areproduced worldwide each year.
07:45:04.251 So what makes eiderdown so expensive?
07:45:12.050 Eiderdown is the soft underfeathers of the common eider,
07:45:15.304 used to protect it from arctic conditions
07:45:17.472 and freezing cold seas.
07:45:19.892 During the breeding season,this down naturally sheds,
07:45:22.561 and the female ducks useit to build their nest.
07:45:26.523 This is where the eiderdowncollectors come in.
07:45:28.984 Eiderdown farmers acrossIceland will harvest this down
07:45:31.612 either by taking smallamounts from each nest
07:45:34.031 or waiting for the birdsto disappear completely
07:45:36.116 before collecting.
07:45:37.659 Erla Friðriksdóttir: Theeiderdown is a natural product,
07:45:39.620 and when the eider duck leaves the nest,
07:45:42.247 they leave the down,
07:45:43.582 and so if we would not take the down,
07:45:46.668 it would just blow away and be useless.
07:45:52.299 Narrator: While this product is natural
07:45:53.550 and ethically harvested,
07:45:54.885 it's not particularly practical to source.
07:45:57.304 Farmers have to find andcollect every nest by hand,
07:46:00.933 and each one containsjust 15 grams of down.
07:46:05.145 Friðriksdóttir: We have 240islands in Breiðafjörður,
07:46:09.274 and the islands that theeider duck nests are in
07:46:13.195 are 150,
07:46:14.988 and we have to go between allthe islands by small boats.
07:46:18.700 The nests are not veryclose to each other,
07:46:22.120 so we have to walk around allthe islands to find the nests.
07:46:26.917 And it can be difficult to find the nest.
07:46:30.462 It's sometimes hidden between rocks
07:46:33.256 or high grass or high plants,
07:46:35.926 and we have to look verycarefully to find all the nests,
07:46:39.471 and I'm sure we do not find all of them.
07:46:43.850 Narrator: But once the down is harvested,
07:46:45.352 the work has only just begun.
07:46:47.813 Up to 80% of the weight of the harvest
07:46:49.856 is made up of sticks,seaweed, or larger feathers,
07:46:52.776 and all of this needs to be removed.
07:46:55.362 The eiderdown is first moved to an oven
07:46:57.364 and baked at 120 degrees Celsiusfor at least eight hours,
07:47:01.201 drawing out any of the unwanted debris
07:47:03.161 and making it easier to sort.
07:47:05.539 Then it goes through multiplespecially made machines,
07:47:08.458 each one sorting more andmore pieces from the down.
07:47:12.754 A larger spinning machineseparates the outer feathers,
07:47:15.424 but the only way to makesure every single one
07:47:17.384 of these feathers is removed is by hand.
07:47:22.514 Friðriksdóttir: After cleaningeiderdown in the machines,
07:47:24.474 we have to clean the eiderdown by hand,
07:47:27.477 and it takes about four or five hours
07:47:30.522 for experienced person to pick 1 kilo.
07:47:35.527 Narrator: Once every feather has been
07:47:36.695 laboriously removed by hand,
07:47:38.405 the down is ready to be washed, pressed,
07:47:40.365 and dried one final time.
07:47:43.410 For the few that can afford it,
07:47:44.828 the final eiderdown is worth the work.
07:47:47.247 Compared to other goose or duck down,
07:47:49.291 eiderdown is denser,stronger, and more insulating.
07:47:52.502 Small barbs in theindividual eiderdown plumes
07:47:55.005 trap the air and make itmore wind resistant, too.
07:47:58.842 The majority of the eiderdownthat King Eider produces
07:48:01.470 is sold as is for companiesto use in their products,
07:48:04.598 but it also sells itsown pillows and duvets.
07:48:08.769 Eider ducks are strictlyprotected in Iceland.
07:48:11.063 It's illegal to hunt themor to sell their eggs,
07:48:13.648 and the final down isclosely monitored too.
07:48:18.320 Friðriksdóttir: 1970,there were laws in Iceland
07:48:22.657 that we must certify alleiderdown that is sold,
07:48:27.079 and also when we are making some products,
07:48:29.790 like duvets or pillows or some garments,
07:48:33.835 we must book a time with the inspector,
07:48:38.840 and he must check thequality and the weight
07:48:42.636 before we fill the product.
07:48:45.472 Narrator: This rigorous system means
07:48:46.723 that every single eiderdownproduct in Iceland
07:48:48.934 has been checked by an inspector.
07:48:51.937 Other countries have theirown certification systems,
07:48:54.356 but Iceland produces about80% of the world's eiderdown.
07:48:58.902 Unlike industrially farmed down,
07:49:00.654 which is often a byproductof the meat industry
07:49:02.864 and one that can ofteninvolve battery farming
07:49:05.075 and live plucking of geese,
07:49:06.993 all of the eider ducks are kept wild.
07:49:09.204 And while the processitself is labor intensive,
07:49:11.665 a large part of the job of farmers
07:49:13.625 is keeping the ducks safe.
07:49:16.878 Friðriksdóttir: The first step is
07:49:18.755 protecting the area for the eider ducks
07:49:21.633 and trying to attract theeider ducks to the areas.
07:49:26.721 There are predators like fox and minks
07:49:30.225 and also gulls and ravens,
07:49:34.354 and the farmers try tokeep the predators away.
07:49:38.316 Some of the farmers make some fences,
07:49:40.861 and some farmers use some bright colors
07:49:45.490 or maybe noises to keepthe predators away,
07:49:49.327 so it's lot of work to watch the area.
07:49:54.499 Narrator: Get all of this right, though,
07:49:55.917 and the end result is one of the
07:49:57.252 warmest natural fibers on the planet.
07:50:04.843 Narrator: With a single tap,
07:50:06.344 Mike Dadson canturn a faulty oboe
07:50:09.014 into one of the world'smost expensive instruments.
07:50:12.017 Mike: And thenhopefully at the end,
07:50:13.602 we should achieve a
07:50:18.190 bottle-tight joint.
07:50:19.941 Narrator: Whenhe's done with it,
07:50:21.193 this oboe will costalmost $14,000.
07:50:25.363 That's more thanfour times the price
07:50:27.365 of some professional flutes.
07:50:29.534 We like to sayyou're only as good
07:50:30.785 as your lastoboe, basically.
07:50:34.206 Very good.
07:50:36.416 Narrator: But before itreaches Mike's desk,
07:50:38.418 artisans select, age,and then whittle
07:50:41.463 rare African blackwoodinto an oboe base
07:50:44.090 just millimeters thick.
07:50:46.384 This nearly endangered woodis just one of the factors
07:50:49.262 limiting the productionof quality oboes.
07:50:52.724 So, what makes an oboeso difficult to make?
07:50:55.894 And is that whythey're so expensive?
07:51:00.774 For high-end-oboe producerslike Howarth of London,
07:51:03.568 it takes five years to makean oboe from start to finish.
07:51:07.906 Oboes are one of the mostcomplicated instruments to make,
07:51:11.618 and because they'reprone to cracking,
07:51:13.453 high-end oboes have to bemade of the best materials,
07:51:16.456 like this African blackwood.
07:51:19.000 Howarth buys only2 square meters
07:51:20.919 of African blackwood a year,
07:51:22.754 which costs it $25,000.
07:51:26.424 And obtainingAfrican blackwood —
07:51:28.176 locally calledmpingo — isn't easy.
07:51:32.138 It's harvested from only themiombo woodlands of Africa
07:51:35.183 in countries like Tanzania.
07:51:37.477 And it's a threatened speciesand at risk of endangerment,
07:51:41.606 so loggers are onlyallowed to chop down trees
07:51:43.942 that are over 60 years old.
07:51:46.319 They must submit arequest, acquire a permit,
07:51:49.114 and ultimatelypay a fee of $151
07:51:52.492 per cubic meter they export.
07:51:54.953 The scarcity ofAfrican blackwood
07:51:56.621 looms large overthe industry.
07:51:58.873 African blackwood isn'ttypically farmed.
07:52:01.876 It grows in the wild, soto combat overharvesting,
07:52:05.380 conservationists inKilwa, Tanzania,
07:52:07.966 have gone to greatlengths to ensure
07:52:09.509 these in-demand treesare managed sustainably.
07:52:31.197 Narrator: The most valuablepart of a log is the heart,
07:52:34.326 which becomes thebasis of the oboe.
07:52:37.203 The oboe is acomplex woodwind
07:52:39.205 that supports extensivemechanical keywork.
07:52:42.334 It's subject to moisturegenerated by human breath,
07:52:45.337 making it prone to crackingwhen made with weaker woods.
07:52:48.923 But the same properties thatallow African blackwood
07:52:51.343 to support thecomplexity of an oboe
07:52:53.762 are also what make it sodifficult to work with.
07:52:57.932 The first step in constructionis to shape the wood,
07:53:01.353 which requiresmetalworking equipment.
07:53:04.189 Artisans startby hollowing out
07:53:05.857 what will become theinterior of the instrument.
07:53:09.027 Then they sculpt the exteriorand refine the shape.
07:53:13.573 This process iscarried out carefully
07:53:15.784 over a number of years
07:53:17.035 and with remarkableprecision.
07:53:20.038 The fact that we can turna piece of wood to within
07:53:24.751 two- or three-hundredths ofa millimeter consistently
07:53:28.296 is just remarkable, really.
07:53:30.048 I mean, mostengineering companies
07:53:31.466 are using those tolerancesto work with metal.
07:53:34.386 Narrator: Between eachround of shaping,
07:53:36.221 the wood is stored for atleast a year to mature.
07:53:39.265 Aging the wood ensures it staysstrong and doesn't crack.
07:53:43.103 During the day,we're blowing warm,
07:53:45.397 dry air over the stock,
07:53:47.440 and then at night, thecompressors are turned off.
07:53:50.276 And so we're going fromhot to cold, dry to damp.
07:53:54.155 So we're really treating thatwood stock as badly as we can,
07:53:58.410 because we want itto move and change,
07:54:00.578 and if it's going to crack,
07:54:02.330 let's get it out ofthe system early
07:54:04.249 so we don't wasteany time on it.
07:54:06.501 Narrator: But the woodisn't the only thing
07:54:07.836 that contributes tothe overall price.
07:54:10.505 Once the basic shape ofthe oboe is complete,
07:54:13.133 artisans begin to create
07:54:14.426 the oboe's complexmechanical keywork.
07:54:17.762 After drilling theinitial tone holes,
07:54:19.848 workers solder and filethe keys to shape by hand.
07:54:24.602 The keys are dipped insilver for protection
07:54:27.021 and are then fittedto the oboe body.
07:54:33.528 Narrator: This stepalone can take
07:54:35.113 up to 60 hours to complete.
07:54:37.949 According to Howarth,
07:54:38.950 the complexity of the keyworkdetermines the price.
07:54:42.787 The more keys in the oboe, themore expensive it will be.
07:54:46.833 A clarinet has 17keys typically,
07:54:49.377 whereas an oboe hasalmost double that
07:54:51.963 as a student model.
07:54:53.339 Narrator: And aprofessional oboe
07:54:54.716 can have as many as 45 keys.
07:54:57.635 Howarth has invested closeto £1 million in machinery
07:55:01.556 to ensure each componentis at the highest quality.
07:55:05.393 But Howarth says its biggestexpense is the craftspeople.
07:55:09.314 The labor requiredto assemble the oboe
07:55:11.858 accounts for 60% to 80%of Howarth's costs,
07:55:15.820 and it takesyears of training
07:55:17.322 to perfect the artof oboe-making.
07:55:20.325 Every artisan atHowarth boasts
07:55:21.993 at least 20 years ofexperience in the craft.
07:55:25.747 Among these artisansis Mike Dadson,
07:55:28.249 one of Howarth's finishers.
07:55:30.668 He's tasked with fine-tuning
07:55:32.504 the last few elementsof the oboe.
07:55:35.006 One of his mostimportant tasks
07:55:37.008 is fitting cork padsunder the keys.
07:55:40.345 Mike sands downdifferent-size corks
07:55:42.847 until they're paper thin.
07:55:45.225 This step is essential,because a single air leak
07:55:48.186 will render theoboe useless.
07:55:51.022 My engineering needs tobe very good on these,
07:55:53.066 because I'll be fittingthem to the thinness
07:55:55.902 of a very thincigarette paper.
07:55:58.696 And then hopefullyat the end,
07:56:00.365 we should achieve a
07:56:07.247 bottle-tight joint.
07:56:10.208 Narrator: While making anoboe, some of the keys
07:56:12.210 and metal parts willinevitably get slightly bent,
07:56:15.380 and it's Mike'sjob to fix them.
07:56:17.924 If an oboe has asingle imperfection,
07:56:20.385 it can't be soldfor top dollar.
07:56:22.804 Fixing bent keys isa test of patience.
07:56:26.307 Sometimes straighteningout one key
07:56:28.560 can bend anotherpiece elsewhere.
07:56:31.062 I've found the point whereI perceive the bend to be,
07:56:35.316 so hopefully I'lljust be able to ...
07:56:43.575 Narrator: Mike oftentakes over three days
07:56:45.577 to fine-tune an oboe.
07:56:47.412 But all this patientwork pays off.
07:56:51.291 The oboe is nowready to be sold.
07:56:54.168 But with a five-year-longproduction time
07:56:56.254 and increasinglyrare raw materials,
07:56:58.506 the number of oboes Howarthcan make and sell is limited.
07:57:02.594 Its workshop producesonly 800 oboes a year,
07:57:06.097 and of those, only 200are professional-grade.
07:57:09.642 Limited productionresults in higher prices
07:57:12.103 and makes qualityinstruments hard to come by.
07:57:15.440 I can imagine there areless than 20,000 oboes
07:57:19.527 being sold each year.
07:57:21.362 I know that Yamaha make20,000 flutes a month,
07:57:24.490 and that's just Yamaha.
07:57:25.658 So the difference in scaleis absolutely enormous.
07:57:30.371 Narrator: Oboesare also regarded
07:57:31.831 as one of the most difficultinstruments to master.
07:57:34.834 With such a steeplearning curve,
07:57:36.878 there aren't enoughoboe players to justify
07:57:38.838 production on a scale thatwould keep prices low.
07:57:42.133 But professional oboe players,like Emily Pailthorpe,
07:57:45.386 rely on thecontinued production
07:57:47.347 of this centuries-oldinstrument.
07:57:50.350 Emily: I think thisis my fifth Howarth,
07:57:52.310 and I haven't oncehad one crack.
07:57:56.648 Narrator: For Emily,the time and care
07:57:58.358 Howarth puts into each oboe
07:58:00.193 sings through inthe end product,
07:58:02.028 so she doesn't mindthe high cost.
07:58:04.322 Emily: There is noquestion in my mind.
07:58:06.199 They're worth every penny.
07:58:07.867 To play on something that'sso beautifully made,
07:58:09.869 that's suchexcellent quality,
07:58:12.163 means the world to myprofessional career
07:58:14.499 and allows me tojust then relax
07:58:16.918 and be the artist I want be.
07:58:24.342 Narrator: This is themost important moment
07:58:26.844 in the process of creatinga South Sea pearl:
07:58:29.972 the moment when Heri insertsthe nucleus into an oyster,
07:58:33.768 around which apearl will form.
07:58:36.270 And if he's imprecise,
07:58:37.939 the resulting pearl maycome out misshapen.
07:58:41.192 The goal is this: anear-perfect round pearl,
07:58:45.530 with a large20-millimeter diameter.
07:58:48.533 That's more thantwice the size
07:58:50.034 of the more commonAkoya pearl.
07:58:52.662 And this single pearlcan sell for $1,500,
07:58:56.332 compared to $75 for ahigh-grade Akoya pearl.
07:59:00.545 A necklace of near-perfectSouth Sea pearls
07:59:03.214 can cost over $200,000.
07:59:06.634 So, why is making these pearlsso much more difficult?
07:59:10.555 And what makesthem so expensive?
07:59:14.976 South Sea refers tothe southern portion
07:59:17.228 of the Pacific Ocean.
07:59:19.147 In these waters, just off thecoast of Lombok, Indonesia,
07:59:22.859 pearl farms like Afdhol Pearlare growing cultured pearls.
07:59:27.405 These are pearlsthat require a human
07:59:29.991 to put somethinginside an oyster
07:59:32.410 instead of harvestingnaturally occurring pearls.
07:59:35.997 And South Sea pearls arethe most expensive variety
07:59:39.167 of cultured pearls.
07:59:40.918 That's in part becauseof how long it takes
07:59:43.838 to make a South Sea pearl.
07:59:46.090 While some freshwateroysters can churn out
07:59:48.509 dozens of smaller pearlswithin three months,
07:59:51.512 it takes about five years
07:59:53.264 to cultivate a singleSouth Sea pearl.
07:59:57.059 The oyster it comes from,the Pinctada maxima,
08:00:00.104 can only make one at a time.
08:00:02.774 And only a fourth of theseoysters survive cultivation.
08:00:06.778 That's why the pearl farmershave to go to great lengths
08:00:10.114 to keep the oysters alive.
08:00:13.618 It starts in this highlycontrolled laboratory,
08:00:16.913 where lab technicians mustcreate the perfect conditions
08:00:19.916 for oyster larvae togrow into healthy,
08:00:22.251 pearl-producing adults.
08:00:24.712 They have to maintaina room temperature
08:00:26.964 of exactly 20degrees Celsius
08:00:29.383 and feed the larvae thephytoplankton they need to grow.
08:00:33.471 To do this, they combine saltwater from the South Sea
08:00:37.141 and sodium hydroxide
08:00:38.768 and store it for five daysuntil there's enough plankton.
08:00:43.064 Lab techs feed the planktonto nets of baby oysters
08:00:46.651 and monitor their growthfor about 45 days.
08:00:49.987 That's around thetime they reach
08:00:51.155 at least 1 millimeterin diameter
08:00:53.658 and are old enough tobe transferred to sea.
08:00:57.161 The oysters are transferredto save on the costs
08:00:59.831 of rearing bigger oysters,which can get expensive.
08:01:14.637 Narrator: In the South Sea, theoysters get the warm waters
08:01:17.640 and food theyneed to mature.
08:01:20.017 But this is also wheremost of them will die
08:01:22.770 without producinga single pearl.
08:01:38.286 Narrator: That'swhy pearl farmers
08:01:39.704 have to check on theoysters monthly,
08:01:41.706 to ensure they're stillgrowing, eating, and healthy.
08:01:46.043 They pull the nets ofoysters up from the sea
08:01:48.504 and clean the shells.
08:01:50.506 This helps prevent predatorsfrom feeding off the oysters
08:01:53.551 and eventually killing them.
08:02:20.661 Narrator: After up totwo years of nursing,
08:02:22.705 when the oysters are largeenough, implantation can begin.
08:02:27.752 For cultured pearls,
08:02:29.211 implantation is themost important step.
08:02:32.715 When a nucleus is implanted,
08:02:34.675 the oyster seesit as an irritant
08:02:36.761 and reacts by building protectivelayers of nacre around it.
08:02:40.890 This becomes the pearl.
08:02:45.102 Heri is demonstrating wherethe nucleus is implanted
08:02:48.230 on an opened oyster.
08:03:04.872 Narrator: He tearsthe oyster's gonads
08:03:06.749 and injects thenucleus in the middle.
08:03:13.464 He then adds saibounder the nucleus.
08:03:17.051 Saibo is a mantle tissuecut from another oyster
08:03:19.971 that surrounds theimplanted nucleus.
08:03:22.765 It's essential tothe pearl quality.
08:03:25.226 And without it, the oyster won'tproduce any pearls at all.
08:03:29.438 Heri is the only personAfdhol trusts with this step.
08:03:33.484 That's because thenuclei don't come cheap.
08:03:37.071 Mahmud buys thenuclei from Japan.
08:03:39.657 And their cost, inaddition to import taxes,
08:03:42.284 takes 20% of his profits.
08:03:45.496 And he says gettingimport permits
08:03:47.331 for these nucleiis difficult,
08:03:49.333 preventing him from buyingenough to expand his business.
08:03:53.629 After the nucleusis implanted,
08:03:55.673 special attention is paid tohow the nacre grows around it
08:03:58.968 to avoid a misshapen pearl.
08:04:01.512 They're workingtowards a large,
08:04:03.347 almost perfectlyround pearl.
08:04:06.475 Workers invert the oysters
08:04:08.310 and put them in their protectivenets to bring back to sea.
08:04:12.106 The South Sea pearl'sunique soft, satiny luster
08:04:15.860 and thick nacre are a result ofthe warm waters it grows in.
08:04:20.614 And a thick nacremeans a large pearl.
08:04:24.035 Heri says they mustflip them regularly
08:04:26.662 so the nacre grows evenly.
08:04:45.222 Narrator: After 40 days,workers remove the oysters
08:04:47.892 from the sea andclean them weekly.
08:04:51.812 Heri checks the implantedoysters monthly
08:04:54.148 to see how the pearlis developing.
08:04:56.484 This is done forup to two years
08:04:58.569 before the first pearlcan be harvested.
08:05:21.759 Narrator: Heri implants thesame oyster two more times.
08:05:25.262 Each time, the pearlAfdhol harvests is bigger.
08:05:29.100 By the third harvest,the pearl can reach
08:05:31.102 over 20 millimetersin diameter
08:05:33.104 and over 8 grams in weight.
08:05:35.606 But as much as pearlfarms like Mahmud invest
08:05:38.109 in the intense care neededto raise the oysters,
08:05:41.278 the outcome isnever guaranteed.
08:05:44.281 Mahmud says only 20% ofthe oysters that survive
08:05:47.535 make the most valuablekind of pearl,
08:05:49.870 almost perfectly round,lustrous, and large.
08:05:54.250 Mahmud grades thepearls based on size,
08:05:56.710 luster, shape, and color.
08:06:00.214 The larger,rounder, shinier,
08:06:01.966 minimally blemished pearlsget the highest grade.
08:06:05.261 That can be AAA or AAAA,
08:06:07.471 depending on the producer.
08:06:10.474 Mahmud then sells them tojewelers like Riana Meilia,
08:06:14.478 who fashions the pearls intonecklaces, earrings, and rings.
08:06:18.816 Riana seeks out the highestgrade she can find,
08:06:21.735 but it isn't easy.
08:06:36.500 Narrator: Lower gradesare more available,
08:06:38.419 but they're rougher,asymmetrical, and lack shine.
08:06:42.339 And in the jewelry world,those are the least desirable.
08:06:46.260 But even the highest-gradepearls are not perfectly round.
08:06:50.181 That's because eventhough they're farmed,
08:06:52.683 they're stillnatural pearls.
08:06:54.685 So finding anear-perfect pearl,
08:06:56.937 let alone enough tomake a string necklace,
08:06:59.356 is extremely rare.
08:07:01.775 It took nine yearsfor Riana to find
08:07:03.694 enough AAA-grade pearlsto make this necklace.
08:07:07.531 She's finally ableto sell it this year
08:07:09.867 for $36,000 toa local buyer.
08:07:14.121 That makes sourcingthese expensive pearls
08:07:16.290 worth it for Riana,who relies on farmers
08:07:18.709 to continue to producehigh-quality pearls.
08:07:22.796 But Mahmud sayspearl farmers
08:07:24.840 need more supportfrom the government,
08:07:26.842 specifically around makingnuclei readily available.
08:07:40.940 Narrator: With thiskind of support,
08:07:42.441 pearl farmers say they couldincrease their production
08:07:45.110 and make IndonesianSouth Sea pearls
08:07:47.655 more readily availableinternationally.
08:07:52.243 Narrator: This is Kenji.
08:07:54.370 He's using acenturies-old technique
08:07:56.789 to dye silk for a kimono.
08:07:59.541 It's physically demanding,
08:08:01.210 but that's not theonly challenge.
08:08:03.587 He has to matchthis color exactly,
08:08:06.090 making adjustments by eye.
08:08:08.884 And it's essential
08:08:10.094 that the fabric insidethis barrel remains white.
08:08:14.265 Kenji won't know if he'ssuccessful until he opens the lid.
08:08:21.897 This is one of over 20 stepsrequired to make a kimono.
08:08:27.027 You can buy a cottonkimono for $300.
08:08:30.656 But a handmade Chiso kimono
08:08:32.908 can cost over $10,000.
08:08:36.453 And the company's mostexpensive kimonos
08:08:38.706 cost 10 times that.
08:08:41.333 We followed 10artisans, step-by-step,
08:08:44.545 to find out what makesthese kimonos so expensive.
08:08:50.175 Versions of the kimono havebeen worn for centuries.
08:08:53.929 Today, the kimono isviewed as formal wear,
08:08:57.349 worn on specialoccasions like weddings
08:08:59.685 or coming-of-age ceremonies.
08:09:01.937 Part of the reason why Chiso'skimonos are so expensive
08:09:05.357 is that they're madeentirely out of silk.
08:09:08.819 It takes around12 meters of silk
08:09:11.363 to make a single kimono.
08:09:14.366 Chiso collaborateswith a network
08:09:16.118 of highly skilled artisans;
08:09:18.454 each step is done by hand
08:09:20.080 and can take weeksto complete.
08:09:23.167 This intricate design startsout as a simple sketch.
08:09:55.115 Narrator: Once thedesign is ready,
08:09:56.909 Hiroshi transfersit to the silk.
08:09:59.620 This step iscalled drafting,
08:10:01.497 and it can takeup to two weeks.
08:10:04.333 Hiroshi ensures thatthe design looks good
08:10:06.251 when the kimono is worn,
08:10:07.920 not just on a flat surface.
08:10:10.923 These lines are criticalto the design process,
08:10:14.134 but you won't see themon the finished kimono.
08:10:17.429 This paint is washed away
08:10:19.181 after acting as a guidefor other artisans.
08:10:22.601 Hiroshi has 37 yearsof experience,
08:10:25.938 but he's still verycritical of his work.
08:10:45.624 Narrator: Chiso'skimonos are known for
08:10:47.084 their complex patterns,
08:10:48.752 painted using atechnique called yūzen.
08:10:52.089 Artisans trace the designwith a glue-like paste
08:10:55.050 that separates colorswhen the silk is painted.
08:10:58.011 It also gives acharacteristic white outline
08:11:00.681 to parts of the design.
08:11:13.360 Narrator: It's patientwork, but Ai says
08:11:15.696 it's all worth it when shesees the finished kimono.
08:11:47.853 Narrator: This is just thestart of a monthslong process.
08:11:52.399 Pieces of thekimono are sent off
08:11:53.942 to different artisansacross Kyoto.
08:11:56.945 Each artisan mustperfect their section
08:11:59.865 while keeping in mindthe final design.
08:12:03.452 At Yoko's workshop, shedyes the base of the kimono
08:12:06.622 with these large brushes.
08:12:24.306 Narrator: Yoko and herassistant blend the edges,
08:12:26.975 working around the design.
08:12:29.520 But this isn't the onlyway kimonos are dyed.
08:12:33.106 Some are dyed using atechnique called shibori,
08:12:37.027 which creates bold colorsand distinct shapes.
08:12:40.781 But it's very tedious work.
08:12:43.450 Before Kenji starts working,
08:12:45.327 artisans sew up the silkand bind this barrel.
08:13:02.886 Narrator: The seamHiromi is sewing
08:13:04.721 forms the edgeof the design.
08:13:07.683 Then Matsuyama wraps thesilk along this wooden tub
08:13:11.436 and tacks it into placebefore he attaches the lid.
08:13:16.233 This step is key to preventingdye from bleeding inside.
08:13:28.579 Now it's time forKenji to dip the silk.
08:13:38.797 He works quickly butconstantly monitors the silk
08:13:41.592 to ensure it'sdyed correctly.
08:13:44.303 If the barrel remains inthe dye for too long,
08:13:46.805 the colors willstart to bleed.
08:13:49.391 Kenji cuts astrip of fabric,
08:13:51.518 compares it to the swatch,
08:13:53.312 and adjusts hisdye accordingly.
08:14:15.584 Narrator: After thedyeing is complete,
08:14:17.628 Kenji lifts the lidand examines his work.
08:14:24.009 All of these stepscombine to tell a story
08:14:27.054 through the designof the kimono.
08:14:30.349 Themes of nature or theseasons are common,
08:14:33.393 while some designsreference poems or plays.
08:14:37.356 One of the most skilledand delicate steps
08:14:40.192 is the yūzen dyeing.
08:14:43.445 Tomoko has 25 years ofexperience making kimonos.
08:15:01.713 Narrator: Yūzen dyeing hasbeen practiced for centuries
08:15:04.716 and has become an iconicfeature of high-end kimonos.
08:15:09.304 The technique ismore expensive
08:15:10.847 and time-consumingthan screen printing,
08:15:12.974 but Chiso's customersare willing
08:15:14.643 to pay a premiumfor the result.
08:15:17.187 Long-sleeved kimonoswith complicated designs
08:15:19.564 can take two to threeweeks to paint.
08:16:10.282 Narrator: The finalstep in the process
08:16:12.117 is for artisans toapply gold leaf
08:16:14.453 and embroidercomplex designs.
08:16:17.372 Embroidery alone cantake weeks to months,
08:16:20.208 depending on the design.
08:16:22.252 The more embroiderya kimono has,
08:16:24.337 the more expensiveit will be.
08:16:27.507 When all the piecesfall into place,
08:16:29.468 the finished kimonois a work of art —
08:16:32.220 a testament to theskill of each artisan
08:16:34.556 who has worked on the silk.
08:17:22.646 Narrator: Chiso's kimonos takesix to 12 months to make,
08:17:25.774 and those hundredsof hours of labor
08:17:27.818 are reflected in the price.
08:17:30.153 Most range from$7,000 to $14,000.
08:17:34.324 But some of Chiso'selaborate designs
08:17:36.535 cost over $100,000.
08:17:39.704 And the accessoriestraditionally worn with a kimono
08:17:42.582 increase theprice even more.
08:18:02.102 Narrator: Customers lookingfor less expensive kimonos
08:18:04.646 might choose to rent, orto buy refurbished ones,
08:18:08.024 which usually cost afew hundred dollars
08:18:10.235 but still providegood quality.
08:18:12.571 Buying a cotton kimono orone without complex yūzen
08:18:15.949 is much more affordable.
08:18:18.201 These kimonos are often wornfor less formal events.
08:18:22.080 But current demand for expensive,complex kimonos is low.
08:18:26.334 Kimono sales declineddramatically
08:18:28.295 in the '90s duringJapan's economic crash.
08:18:31.756 And the industry hascontinued to shrink.
08:18:34.634 Today, it's around 14% ofthe size it was in 1975.
08:18:39.890 Chiso sells around 4,000kimonos each year,
08:18:43.226 but the relevance of the garmentin modern life is limited.
08:18:59.242 Narrator: Furthercomplicating matters,
08:19:01.036 the artisans it relies uponto maintain production
08:19:04.080 are getting older.
08:19:47.707 Narrator: The futureof this centuries-old
08:19:49.501 clothing traditiondepends on the skill
08:19:51.753 of the artisanswho practice it.
08:20:01.972 Narrator: Ertugrul is carvingout the final details
08:20:04.307 of this meerschaum pipe.
08:20:07.602 And when he's done, a pipelike this can cost over $300.
08:20:13.316 It's made of meerschaum,
08:20:14.985 a mineral rock often found inunderground mines in Turkey
08:20:18.154 that reach 137 meters deep.
08:20:22.283 The most intricate pipes
08:20:23.451 can take up to twomonths to complete.
08:20:26.496 Those can go forover $7,000.
08:20:30.250 But meerschaum is fragile,
08:20:31.835 which means Ertugrulcan lose all his work
08:20:34.629 at the last minute.
08:20:44.514 [laughing]
08:20:46.516 Narrator: So, whatsets meerschaum pipes
08:20:48.643 apart from the rest?
08:20:50.270 And why are theyso expensive?
08:21:10.832 Narrator: Turkish people havebeen making meerschaum pipes
08:21:13.168 since the early 1600s.
08:21:15.879 Meerschaum, also known assepiolite, is a clay-like mineral.
08:21:20.008 It's lightweight, porous,and heat-resistant,
08:21:23.344 making it idealfor pipe smoking.
08:21:26.723 Its porousness allows it toabsorb tar and nicotine,
08:21:29.851 reducing howmuch is inhaled,
08:21:31.895 which some pipesmokers prefer.
08:21:35.565 Meerschaum is foundall over the world,
08:21:37.817 but the most commerciallyimportant meerschaum
08:21:40.153 is mined nearEskisehir in Turkey.
08:21:43.073 It's locally referredto as "white gold"
08:21:45.408 for its economicand cultural value.
08:21:48.912 To make meerschaum pipes,
08:21:50.580 artisans first seek thehighest-quality meerschaum,
08:21:53.708 known as the "right" grade.
08:21:55.919 The higher the grade,
08:21:57.087 the less prone themeerschaum is to cracking,
08:21:59.089 so they're willing to paymore than double the price
08:22:01.091 of the lower "sandy" grade.
08:22:05.386 The right grade ofmeerschaum is rare
08:22:07.263 and difficult to obtain.
08:22:09.182 Meerschaum is located inunderground quarries,
08:22:11.768 and here in Kozlubel,
08:22:13.436 miners have foundhigh-grade meerschaum.
08:22:16.940 Emre now carves pipes,
08:22:18.942 but he got his start inthe industry as a miner.
08:22:21.945 He's taking us 44meters belowground,
08:22:24.781 where he'll chiselat surrounding rocks
08:22:26.616 to find suitable meerschaum.
08:22:36.709 Miners make educated guessesas to where to start,
08:22:40.213 typically near depositsthey've already mined.
08:22:44.634 The work isphysically demanding,
08:22:46.594 and even the strongestlaborers can take an hour
08:22:48.972 to remove just one stone.
08:22:53.643 But that's onlyif they find it.
08:23:03.319 Narrator: The goal is tofind larger meerschaum rocks
08:23:05.947 that are at leastthe size of a fist.
08:23:20.170 Narrator: This stone cansell for at least $38.
08:23:23.756 Emre says larger meerschaumhas higher heat resistance,
08:23:27.010 up to 4,000 degreesFahrenheit.
08:23:34.309 Narrator: The biggerthe meerschaum stone,
08:23:35.977 the more elaborate,and eventually,
08:23:37.812 the more expensivethe pipe will be.
08:23:40.690 But artisans like Emre canonly make as many pipes
08:23:43.693 as the meerschaumsupply allows.
08:23:56.289 Narrator: Though Emre canspend up to $2,200 at a time
08:23:59.542 on raw meerschaum,that's still not enough
08:24:02.337 to meet the demand forthe finished pipes.
08:24:14.349 Narrator: ErtugrulCevher is one of the few
08:24:16.309 master pipe carversin all of Turkey.
08:24:18.978 He's been making meerschaumpipes for over 50 years.
08:24:23.566 Aside from the cost ofthe meerschaum itself,
08:24:26.069 the final priceof these pipes
08:24:27.403 comes down to skilland craftsmanship.
08:24:31.658 To start making the pipe,
08:24:33.409 Ertugrul removes anydirt from the stone
08:24:35.912 and cuts around fault lines
08:24:37.330 that may latercause it to break.
08:24:40.250 This sometimes meanslopping off three-quarters
08:24:42.585 of the meerschaum stone.
08:24:47.757 He then carves out therough shape of the pipe.
08:24:54.097 He air-dries the pipeto strengthen it,
08:24:56.182 then drills in guide holesfor the mouth and body.
08:25:00.561 Ertugrul refinesthe pipe again
08:25:02.563 with four different sandpapersto remove any flaws
08:25:05.400 and to ensure asmooth surface.
08:25:10.571 Simpler pipes like thesecan sell for over $100.
08:25:14.200 But complex pipes, likethis Ottoman sultan head,
08:25:17.245 require further handiwork,which can triple the price.
08:25:21.958 Ertugrul doesn't plan thedesign for his pieces.
08:25:24.627 He works frommemory and feel,
08:25:26.629 so each of his pipes isa unique work of art.
08:25:31.884 After hand-carvingevery minor detail,
08:25:34.304 Ertugrul startsshaping the stem.
08:25:38.141 The stem'smaterials can vary.
08:25:40.310 Ebonite is used formore expensive pipes,
08:25:42.145 while acrylic is used formore affordable ones.
08:25:46.274 The stem is polished, then fitinto the mouth of the pipe.
08:25:50.653 Next, Ertugrul dipsthe pipes in beeswax,
08:25:53.614 which adds a a sheen andfurther hardens the meerschaum,
08:25:56.659 prolonging its durability.
08:26:01.247 But even when worked byskilled hands like Ertugrul's,
08:26:04.083 the meerschaum is liableto break unexpectedly
08:26:06.336 at any point in the process.
08:26:19.682 Narrator: The riskof this happening,
08:26:21.017 especially withcomplex pipes
08:26:22.352 that can take up to twomonths to complete,
08:26:24.854 means sometimes Ertugrul'swork is all for nothing.
08:26:30.193 But when he canfinish a pipe,
08:26:31.986 it can be soldfor top dollar.
08:26:49.837 Narrator: Meerschaumpipes at this price point
08:26:51.672 are typically large,intricate collectibles
08:26:54.217 that are also functional.
08:27:14.987 Narrator: Today, meerschaumpipes are in high demand
08:27:17.365 by collectors andsmokers alike.
08:27:19.575 But that hasn'talways been the case.
08:27:22.036 Around the turn ofthe millennium,
08:27:23.704 a rise in anti-smoking laws
08:27:25.206 and the availability ofalternative materials
08:27:27.417 cratered the marketfor meerschaum pipes.
08:27:29.919 Things took a turn in 2011
08:27:32.547 with the rise of tourism inTurkey after the Arab Spring.
08:27:35.925 As tourism continuedto increase,
08:27:37.927 Emre saw meerschaumpipes regain popularity.
08:27:41.264 And the global pipe industryis set to grow even further,
08:27:44.392 at a rate of 4.5% by 2031.
08:27:48.771 Yet as demand formeerschaum pipes increases,
08:27:51.357 Ertugrul fears theprofession can't keep up.
08:28:31.647 It can take 30 kilos of raw wool
08:28:34.859 to make a singleMoroccan rug.
08:28:38.112 Women tie each knot byhand, one row at a time.
08:28:42.200 Instead of using guides, theywork from their imagination.
08:28:55.796 Narrator: When soldonline, authentic rugs
08:28:58.049 can cost over $2,000.
08:29:00.885 But the women who make themoften receive the least profit.
08:29:04.764 The most Fadma hassold a rug for: $600.
08:29:09.185 Most of the profits aretaken by middlemen,
08:29:11.604 who buy the rugsfrom artisans
08:29:13.105 and sell them for severaltimes more in big markets.
08:29:17.068 Authentic rugs also compete
08:29:19.028 with knockoffs madeoutside of Morocco.
08:29:36.045 Narrator: Today,dozens of cooperatives
08:29:38.214 are working together tofight for a fair wage.
08:29:41.717 We went to Moroccoto find out
08:29:43.177 why these artisansstruggle to earn a profit
08:29:45.846 while the rugsare so expensive.
08:29:49.892 Deep in the Atlas Mountains,
08:29:51.561 there are thousands of artisansweaving rugs like this.
08:29:55.856 They've been woventhroughout Morocco
08:29:57.400 for centuries byAmazigh tribes.
08:30:06.951 Narrator: Fadma has beenmaking rugs her whole life.
08:30:09.787 She says weaving is muchmore than just a job.
08:30:24.635 Narrator: Her day startswith making bread.
08:30:27.221 Besides weaving, the womenhere are responsible
08:30:29.682 for childcare andhousehold chores.
08:30:32.852 Artisans use woolfrom local sheep,
08:30:35.354 but there's a lotof work to do
08:30:36.814 before this woolis ready to weave.
08:30:39.734 Raw wool startsout like this.
08:30:42.236 Artisans carry the wool toa nearby river to wash it,
08:30:45.740 removing any dirt or debris.
08:30:49.035 Once the wool dries,artisans spin it into yarn.
08:30:54.707 These large combsuntangle the fibers
08:30:57.126 in a process called carding.
08:31:01.088 Artisans spin thewool two times,
08:31:03.132 combining threads fora sturdier result.
08:31:08.763 It's patient work,but Fadma says
08:31:11.182 working together makesit more enjoyable.
08:31:43.381 Narrator: These womenare part of the
08:31:44.715 Kasbah Taznakht cooperative,
08:31:46.634 one of around 50in the region.
08:31:49.512 Their aim is to helpeach other weave
08:31:51.472 and to sell rugs directly,cutting out the middlemen.
08:32:11.575 Narrator: Having severalartisans is especially useful
08:32:14.120 when weaving a large rug.
08:32:16.414 They measure out the length
08:32:17.498 and hammer two stakesinto the ground.
08:32:20.376 Artisans walk the yarn backand forth dozens of times
08:32:23.879 to start the rug.
08:32:25.756 The rest of the rug iswoven into this base.
08:32:30.094 From here, artisansunravel the yarn
08:32:32.680 and attach it to the loom.
08:32:44.567 This marks the startof weeks of work.
08:32:50.114 Moroccan rugs are thick,soft, and durable,
08:32:54.326 thanks to the wool fromlocal mountain sheep.
08:32:58.581 Debagh has around300 sheep and goats.
08:33:02.084 He shears them in March
08:33:03.127 and sells most ofthe wool to weavers.
08:33:29.612 Narrator: Debagh sells his woolfor around $10 per kilogram.
08:33:52.927 Narrator: Back atthe cooperative,
08:33:54.303 artisans are busydyeing the wool.
08:33:58.891 They use natural ingredients
08:34:00.309 that create richand varied colors.
08:34:04.897 Artisans mix alumstones in boiling water
08:34:07.650 to help the yarnabsorb the dye.
08:34:10.277 Fadma uses ingredientslike rosemary and henna.
08:34:13.656 She uses pomegranatepeel to make yellow.
08:34:17.326 Keeping track of whatthe raw materials cost
08:34:19.703 and factoring that intothe price of a rug
08:34:21.705 is another challenge.
08:34:23.582 Artisans who use natural dyesinstead of chemical dyes
08:34:26.627 need more raw materials.
08:34:28.921 And some of theseingredients, like madder,
08:34:31.298 a root used for red dye,
08:34:33.217 are expensive whenbought in large amounts.
08:34:37.179 This dyed yarn formsFadma's palette of colors
08:34:40.140 that she weaves into thebase to form a design.
08:34:44.353 When all the materials areready, Fadma starts to weave.
08:34:57.408 Narrator: Each knotis tied individually,
08:34:59.660 one row at a time.
08:35:02.121 After decades of practice,
08:35:03.539 Fadma is able to quickly weavedyed yarn through the base.
08:35:35.654 Narrator: Eachregion of Morocco
08:35:36.822 has its own designsand motifs,
08:35:39.783 like Beni Ourain fromthe Middle Atlas
08:35:42.870 or Taznakht rugs fromnorthwestern Africa,
08:35:45.497 which use severalweaving techniques
08:35:47.416 to create complex patterns.
08:35:50.502 On large rugs, artisanswork side by side.
08:35:54.590 The more complicated the pattern,the harder it is to weave.
08:35:58.594 Large rugs can takemonths to make,
08:36:01.388 and the bigger the rug, themore expensive it becomes.
08:36:37.508 Narrator: Unfortunately,weaving a beautiful rug
08:36:39.802 doesn't guarantee a profit.
08:36:41.929 Most weavers live andwork in rural areas
08:36:44.807 with limited accessto transportation.
08:36:47.309 They don't haveaccess to the markets
08:36:49.520 and are exploitedby middlemen.
08:36:51.689 These obstaclesmake it challenging
08:36:53.524 for women to selltheir rugs directly.
08:38:00.674 Narrator: Severaldirect-trade companies
08:38:02.509 partner with weavers and pay ahigher price for their rugs.
08:38:05.971 After shipping costsand import taxes,
08:38:08.348 the final priceof a large rug
08:38:10.267 can easily exceed $1,000.
08:38:13.771 But the pay artisans receivefrom these companies varies.
08:38:17.316 It can range from only 20%
08:38:19.318 to over 60% of theprice you see online.
08:38:23.113 Within Morocco, rugs aresold in markets like this
08:38:26.283 that can be foundacross the country.
08:38:28.869 Janah has soldrugs for 30 years.
08:38:31.747 He says his customersare around 60% locals
08:38:34.750 and 40% tourists.
08:39:34.017 Narrator: But the farther arug gets from the weaver,
08:39:36.019 the more expensiveit becomes.
08:39:38.480 And while joining a cooperativecan help increase pay,
08:39:41.358 it doesn't guarantee it.
08:40:16.435 Narrator: Authenticwool rugs also compete
08:40:18.312 with rugs madeoutside of Morocco
08:40:20.272 that imitatetraditional designs.
08:40:22.941 Some of these aremade of wool,
08:40:24.693 but many use cottonor polyester.
08:40:31.867 Like manytraditional crafts,
08:40:33.911 passing on rug makinghas been a challenge.
08:40:54.848 Narrator: But theseartisans say it's important
08:40:56.975 to preserve this tradition.
08:41:44.815 Narrator: If these artisansmake a single mistake
08:41:47.484 laying a flat map overthis giant custom sphere,
08:41:51.113 they'll have to startthe entire process over.
08:41:54.574 The slightest twitch of thefinger can cause a rip,
08:41:57.244 a costly hiccup at Bellerby& Co. Globemakers,
08:41:59.955 where the world's mostexpensive globes are made.
08:42:03.333 A 22-centimeter mass-producedglobe can cost about $25,
08:42:07.921 while a Bellerby globeof the same size
08:42:10.465 can sell for over $3,800.
08:42:14.594 And prices canreach six figures
08:42:16.346 for Bellerby'slargest globes.
08:42:19.266 That's partly because artisanscustomize these globes
08:42:22.019 entirely in-house, includinghand-painting the globe
08:42:25.272 and crafting thebase it sits on.
08:42:28.358 So, what makes theseglobes worth waiting
08:42:30.944 up to two years to get?
08:42:32.988 And why are theyso expensive?
08:42:40.662 Peter: If someone askswhy it's so expensive,
08:42:42.873 I invite them alongto the studio
08:42:45.125 and show them around
08:42:46.043 and show them theprocesses we go through
08:42:48.295 at every single level.
08:42:50.005 When they leave, they fullyunderstand why it takes so long.
08:42:53.675 Narrator: Peter Bellerbyfounded London's
08:42:55.135 Bellerby & Co.Globemakers in 2008,
08:42:58.055 and today, it's one of theonly studios in the world
08:43:01.016 making globes by hand.
08:43:04.186 The smallest globe it sells,
08:43:05.812 the 12-centimeter-diameterpocket globe,
08:43:08.148 can set you backalmost $2,000.
08:43:11.526 Its largest, the Churchill,has a 127-centimeter diameter
08:43:16.365 and costs over $94,000.
08:43:20.994 Since 2008, Bellerby hassold around 5,000 globes,
08:43:25.165 ranging from mapsof the Earth
08:43:26.750 to the constellationsand even the moon.
08:43:31.838 Three of those were featuredin Martin Scorsese's "Hugo,"
08:43:35.175 including a 40-centimetercelestial globe.
08:43:38.678 Production is limited becausemaking a globe from scratch
08:43:41.556 entirely by handis no easy feat.
08:43:44.893 At Bellerby, itrequires cartographers,
08:43:47.396 globemakers, painters,and woodworkers.
08:43:51.942 And the price of these globesis largely a reflection
08:43:54.444 of how many the team can makewithout compromising quality.
08:44:00.242 The attention to detailstarts with the spheres.
08:44:03.245 Most sizes are madefrom fiberglass
08:44:05.205 for its strengthand durability.
08:44:08.250 But what's most important isthat it's a perfect sphere.
08:44:13.755 Any deformation can result inuneven weight distribution,
08:44:17.259 which affects howthe globe spins.
08:44:20.762 If that happens,
08:44:22.055 Bellerby has to fix it byattaching a counterweight.
08:44:25.976 Then there are themaps themselves.
08:44:29.312 The cartography departmentfocuses on accuracy
08:44:32.232 and fulfilling thecustomer's imagination,
08:44:34.609 like adding the Silk Roador the spice routes.
08:44:38.738 Isis: They highlight theplaces where they came from
08:44:41.283 and where they mighthave immigrated to
08:44:43.493 and where they got married
08:44:44.744 and where theirancestors are from.
08:44:49.499 Narrator: But Bellerby doesn'tjust customize its maps
08:44:51.626 for creative orsentimental reasons.
08:44:54.754 The details also affect
08:44:56.298 where the companycan sell its globes.
08:44:58.258 Peter: Forinstance, in India,
08:45:00.677 I can actually go toprison for six months
08:45:02.637 if I ship a globe toIndia that doesn't have
08:45:04.764 the correct border betweenIndia and Pakistan.
08:45:08.810 Narrator: And if anyterritories shift
08:45:10.479 or new borders are drawn,
08:45:12.147 Bellerby's new iterationswill reflect that.
08:45:16.109 When the cartographersare done
08:45:17.444 with all the necessaryspecifications,
08:45:19.779 they print the map ontooblong strips called gores.
08:45:23.825 Now, it can be handed offto globemakers like Eddy.
08:45:27.454 Eddy: So, with globemaking,it's all about applying
08:45:29.372 12 or 24 goresonto a sphere.
08:45:31.958 So it all starts withcutting those gores
08:45:35.170 very, very preciselywith a scalpel.
08:45:40.342 Narrator: Makers haveto cut the gores
08:45:41.885 to within 0.1of a millimeter
08:45:44.346 so there are no gaps oroverlaps when they're applied.
08:45:49.184 Eddy: You can very easilycover an entire country
08:45:51.686 based on the amount thatyou've extra-overlapped
08:45:53.730 because you've cut a littlebit too much excess.
08:45:56.650 Narrator: Eddy traces thelatitude and longitude lines
08:45:59.152 onto the sphere as guides.
08:46:06.034 Then he wets the gores andglues them onto the surface,
08:46:09.746 gently flatteningthem by hand.
08:46:15.085 Even the slightest tensionor miscalculated movement
08:46:18.088 can cause a rip or wrinkle.
08:46:23.552 When globemakersdo make mistakes,
08:46:25.845 they have to scrape off andreplace the offending gore.
08:46:30.392 If they're lucky, they'llonly need to remove one,
08:46:33.395 but sometimes the team hasto redo the entire globe,
08:46:37.190 including the cartography.
08:46:39.526 Eddy: A lot of thetimes it does result
08:46:40.694 in the globebeing restarted,
08:46:42.946 and that can even beat the final stage
08:46:44.739 just before it'sbeing packaged.
08:46:46.199 While that doesn't happenoften, when it does,
08:46:48.451 you know, everybody's upset.
08:46:49.744 But it's just the only way
08:46:52.414 that we can maintain a reallyhigh-quality standard.
08:46:55.458 Narrator: Correctlysetting a single gore
08:46:57.252 onto the massive Churchillglobe can take an hour.
08:47:01.089 Aside from size, factors likethe temperature in the room
08:47:04.092 or the consistency of theglue affect application time.
08:47:07.887 The globemaker has toaccount for all of this,
08:47:10.390 including theirown breathing.
08:47:12.267 Eddy: I've found that coldshowers actually help a lot
08:47:14.269 with controlling breath,
08:47:16.062 and that's really improvedmy making, actually.
08:47:19.566 Narrator: It takesup to 18 months
08:47:21.109 for trainees to learn the mostbasic aspects of globemaking,
08:47:25.280 and much longerto master it.
08:47:27.449 Eddy has been on thejob for six years.
08:47:30.952 When the goresare finally set,
08:47:32.662 the globe is ready forthe painters, like Isis.
08:47:36.249 She can bring theEarth, the moon,
08:47:38.293 or the constellationsto life.
08:47:42.505 She shades in thecoastlines, mountain ranges,
08:47:45.300 political borders, and anyillustrations or customizations.
08:47:49.846 The difficulty on thisstage is actually making
08:47:52.599 all these gores the samecolor and consistent.
08:47:56.770 It's almost like ifyou're making a painting
08:48:00.148 but you have 12different canvases
08:48:02.859 and there has tobe a continuation.
08:48:05.820 Narrator: Some globes highlightdifferent ocean depths,
08:48:08.156 so Isis has to paintin ocean trenches
08:48:10.367 in their exact location.
08:48:13.662 She works deliberately,being careful
08:48:15.789 not to paint neighboringcountries the same shades
08:48:18.291 or let any watercolor runfrom one gore to the next.
08:48:21.336 That's anothermistake that risks
08:48:22.837 having to start the wholeglobe all over again.
08:48:29.219 At the woodshop, artisansare working on a base
08:48:31.971 for the nearly completeChurchill globe.
08:48:34.891 It's all done in-house bya dedicated team of four.
08:48:40.563 They engrave, chisel,and stain the wood
08:48:43.358 based on customerspecifications.
08:48:47.070 At every stage of theglobemaking process,
08:48:49.197 Peter encourages his team totake as long as they need.
08:48:52.659 It's very importantthat we spend the time
08:48:54.869 that is required tomake every single globe
08:48:57.706 as best as it can be.
08:48:58.832 It's finished when it'sfinished and when it's ready.
08:49:01.376 Narrator: The cost of laboraccounts for most of the price,
08:49:03.712 since it usually takesfour to six months
08:49:05.714 to complete a globeand ship it out.
08:49:07.841 But Bellerby also pays attentionto the materials it uses.
08:49:11.428 The inks it usesfor printing
08:49:12.929 can last between 80 and 200years in gallery conditions.
08:49:18.226 The origin storyof Bellerby Globes
08:49:20.186 is just as peculiar asthe globes themselves.
08:49:22.731 In 2008, Peter decidedto make a globe
08:49:25.608 for his father's80th birthday.
08:49:27.402 He went throughhundreds of globes
08:49:28.903 and thousands of pounds beforehe was happy with the result.
08:49:32.282 In about 2011, '12, Isold my house to fund,
08:49:37.036 because this is abottomless pit of money.
08:49:41.916 I used to go down tothe municipal dump
08:49:45.378 every two weeks
08:49:46.963 with an estate car
08:49:48.923 full of trial globes.
08:49:52.302 Narrator: And oncehe got it right,
08:49:53.928 he wanted to keepmaking them.
08:49:56.765 But Peter didn't expectthe warm reception
08:49:58.933 these boutiqueglobes received.
08:50:00.727 The company wasrecently commissioned
08:50:02.562 to work on a globefor the Louvre,
08:50:04.773 and its largest globe hasa wait list of two years.
08:50:08.943 Peter attributes this demand
08:50:10.445 to the rise of consumerinterest in handmade products.
08:50:13.907 The global-handicraft-marketsize
08:50:15.617 reached $680 billion in 2021
08:50:19.120 and is expected to exceed atrillion dollars by 2027.
08:50:23.166 Bellerby & Co. too hasseen this consistent rise
08:50:26.169 in demand for itshandmade globes.
08:50:28.296 The company says it turnsmultimillion-dollar revenues
08:50:31.090 year after year.
08:50:33.343 And it expectsthis to continue,
08:50:35.512 even at high price pointsfor its niche products.
08:50:40.266 What I love so muchabout what we do
08:50:42.977 is that it is sodeeply personal.
08:50:46.523 You can tell someone'swhole life story in it.
08:50:53.154 Narrator: Making bangjjayugi starts here,
08:50:56.199 with molten bronze.
08:50:57.992 And after hundredsof hammer strikes,
08:51:00.495 it's transformedinto some of Korea's
08:51:02.664 most expensive tableware.
08:51:06.334 Artisans work with firesover 1,300 degrees Celsius,
08:51:11.005 carefully reheating the metalbetween rounds of hammering.
08:51:14.801 Too hot, and it will melt.
08:51:17.679 Too cold, and it'll shatter.
08:51:21.307 No molds are usedin this process,
08:51:23.518 only skill and anexperienced eye.
08:51:27.063 When it's done, this ricepot can sell locally
08:51:30.066 for over $350.
08:51:33.069 So, what makes bangjjayugi so labor-intensive?
08:51:36.698 And is that whyit's so expensive?
08:51:40.577 Bangjja yugi refers to Koreanhand-forged bronzeware.
08:51:44.414 It can take many forms,from pots to gongs.
08:51:49.002 While bangjja yugi productionhas largely been modernized,
08:51:52.380 Lee Bong-ju is oneof few yugi masters
08:51:54.716 who continue toproduce certain pieces
08:51:57.218 using traditional methods.
08:52:00.555 Bong-ju, who is 96,
08:52:02.223 has been making traditionalKorean bronzeware
08:52:04.684 for over 70 years.
08:52:14.235 Narrator: In 1983, theSouth Korean government
08:52:16.613 declared him a "livingnational treasure."
08:52:19.616 A single spoon fullyhandcrafted by Bong-ju's team
08:52:22.869 costs $70.
08:52:25.079 A set of seven bowlscosts over $1,800.
08:52:30.043 Bong-ju starts off bymeasuring the ingredients.
08:52:33.880 The perfect bronzealloy for bangjja yugi
08:52:36.215 is in the details —
08:52:38.092 an exact ratio of 78%copper and 22% tin.
08:52:43.598 The metals are heated toover 1,300 degrees Celsius
08:52:46.976 in order to melt and boil.
08:52:49.228 Although the alloy will meltat a lower temperature,
08:52:52.106 Bong-ju says that heatingit to 1,300 degrees
08:52:55.068 ensures it can stretchwithout cracking once cooled.
08:53:13.628 Narrator: They thenpour the molten alloy
08:53:15.338 into a heated stonewith a round cutout.
08:53:18.341 Once the alloy cools,
08:53:19.968 it becomes a bronze platewith a rounded bottom,
08:53:22.804 referred to as a baduk.
08:53:25.932 Bong-ju's team heats thecooled baduks again,
08:53:28.518 so they can hammer themwithout risking breakage.
08:53:31.771 One person cannot hammerthe bronze alone,
08:53:34.649 as they won't be ableto move fast enough
08:53:36.359 before the metal cools.
08:53:38.611 Working quickly in a circle,
08:53:40.488 artisans strikethe red-hot baduk,
08:53:42.824 stretching it untilit's the desired size.
08:53:46.619 Each careful blowof the hammer
08:53:48.538 plays an essential rolein shaping valuable yugi.
08:53:52.667 This also meansone misplaced hit
08:53:55.169 could causeirreparable damage.
08:54:05.513 Narrator: And it's notjust the hammering
08:54:06.806 that can ruin the baduk.
08:54:08.808 Every step of the traditionalprocess is manual,
08:54:11.853 down to fanning the fire.
08:54:14.022 Fanners push andpull the bellows,
08:54:16.024 creating wind tokeep the fire going.
08:54:19.027 They depend on experience todetermine how hot the fire is,
08:54:23.197 and if they allow it to gettoo hot, the bronze melts.
08:54:27.368 This particular fanneris still in training.
08:54:49.015 Narrator: Any defects, andthe bronze can't be sold.
08:54:52.060 It has to be takenout of circulation,
08:54:54.187 remelted, and processedall over again.
08:54:59.567 After another roundof hammering,
08:55:01.110 Bong-ju cuts thebaduk into a circle
08:55:03.196 to the desired diameter.
08:55:20.588 Narrator: The baduk isthen heated back up
08:55:22.423 to working temperature,
08:55:23.883 and the artisansbegin another cycle
08:55:25.760 of carefully hammeringand shaping.
08:55:33.601 Artisans stack the badukson top of each other
08:55:36.062 to shape multiplepieces simultaneously.
08:55:39.273 This is efficient,but it's also safer
08:55:41.609 than working themone at a time.
08:55:43.736 Stacked bronze platesdon't cool as quickly,
08:55:46.114 so they're lesslikely to break.
08:55:48.950 And broken metal doesn'tjust ruin the product;
08:55:51.452 it can also be dangerous.
08:56:14.350 Narrator: Still,only a month later,
08:56:16.602 Bong-ju went back to work.
08:56:21.023 Once the pot takes form, Bong-jucan separate the layers,
08:56:24.694 revealing multipleroughly shaped pots.
08:56:29.991 His team then refinestheir shapes individually.
08:56:39.625 The pot isrepeatedly shaped,
08:56:42.003 trimmed,
08:56:44.130 and shaped again,
08:56:46.215 all freehand,
08:56:48.050 under the skilled and watchfuleye of master Bong-ju.
08:56:54.015 Bronzeworking arrived inKorea around 1300 BC.
08:56:58.477 The art form peaked startingin the 9th century AD,
08:57:01.814 when it began to be exported
08:57:03.191 to neighboring countrieslike China and Japan.
08:57:06.485 The demand for bangjjayugi fluctuated over time,
08:57:09.697 but in the 1980s,
08:57:11.199 producers saw interest inthe bronzeware pick up.
08:57:32.053 Narrator: That'sBong-ju's son.
08:57:33.763 He's been making bangjjayugi for 40 years.
08:57:37.099 He says bangjja isstill popular in Korea.
08:57:40.102 Part of its appeal
08:57:41.395 is its antibacterial andantiseptic properties,
08:57:44.398 particularly againstbacteria like E. coli.
08:57:47.735 But this demand created thenecessity to modernize,
08:57:50.738 to supply more bangjja yugi
08:57:52.198 while cutting downproduction costs.
08:58:18.057 Narrator: Backat the workshop,
08:58:19.225 Bong-ju's team is almostdone making a rice pot.
08:58:26.774 Once the pot is inits near final shape,
08:58:29.443 they quench it bydunking it in water.
08:58:33.739 This removes some ofthe oxidized layers
08:58:35.950 and prepares the potsfor the last stage,
08:58:38.786 shaving off the surface
08:58:40.121 to reveal the soft-tonedbronze underneath.
08:59:01.350 Narrator: Due to the highdemand for quality bangjja
08:59:03.769 and the need tosustain his business,
08:59:05.771 Bong-ju too has mechanizedsome of the process.
08:59:09.984 Even then, it requireshighly skilled labor,
08:59:12.820 as many stages are stillperformed by hand.
08:59:16.157 But for Bong-ju,
08:59:17.283 it's not about how muchbangjja yugi he can make
08:59:19.827 or how much hecan sell it for.
08:59:46.854 But don't we call it the fate of a person? Now,there's nothing in my life but bangjja yugi.
08:59:53.944 Narrator: After craftingthe hand-designed head
08:59:56.030 and customizing the shaft,
08:59:57.782 there's still one stepthat could make the work
09:00:00.034 on these Honma golfclubs all for nothing.
09:00:04.080 If they make a mistakeduring assembly,
09:00:06.415 the instant adhesivewill immediately dry,
09:00:09.001 meaning countless hours ofwork and thousands of dollars
09:00:12.004 will be wasted on asingle golf club.
09:00:15.508 A full set can retailfor more than $50,000,
09:00:19.887 compared to theestimated $4,400
09:00:23.015 it would cost to buy aset to match Tiger Woods.
09:00:27.728 So, are the smallcustom details
09:00:30.147 enough to enhancea golfer's game?
09:00:33.359 And is that why these golfclubs are so expensive?
09:00:40.074 At Honma's factoryin Sakata, Japan,
09:00:42.618 there are roughly 200specialized craftspeople.
09:00:48.290 But the most skilledare called meisho,
09:00:50.709 or master craftsmen.
09:00:53.129 And there are only25 with this title.
09:00:56.340 To earn it, a craftspersonhas to train for five years,
09:00:59.969 then pass an exam.
09:01:03.139 A meisho has theability to create
09:01:05.015 nuanced elementsof a golf club
09:01:07.059 that can be customized downto the finest details.
09:01:28.164 Narrator: For example,the five-star model
09:01:30.207 of Honma's Beres clubsincludes materials
09:01:33.085 like platinum and24-karat gold.
09:01:38.299 But before those luxuryflourishes are ever added,
09:01:41.844 Honma sets itself apartin its modeling process.
09:01:45.973 All golf clubs are splitinto three main parts:
09:01:50.019 the head, the shaft,and the grip.
09:01:53.272 Creating a mastermodel is the first
09:01:55.232 and most important step inproducing a club's head.
09:02:00.029 Satoru Hatanaka is using amore traditional material
09:02:03.449 to create the templatefor a driver.
09:02:06.952 While historically, driverswere made of persimmon wood,
09:02:11.832 today, they're made withlightweight carbon and titanium.
09:02:16.879 But at Honma, the modelthe driver is based on
09:02:20.341 is still made frompersimmon. Why?
09:02:23.385 So craftsmen like Satoru,
09:02:25.429 who has been making drivermodels for 35 years,
09:02:28.557 can sculpt the headof the club by hand.
09:02:52.039 Narrator: The head of an ironneeds a different process.
09:02:56.168 Master craftsman TakumiSato is making the model
09:02:59.505 for a Beres-series 7 iron.
09:03:02.258 When complete, this iron cancost over $1,000 on its own.
09:03:25.948 Narrator: Hismodel will be used
09:03:27.324 to manufacturethe final irons,
09:03:29.243 which are crafted fromtop-of-the-line carbon steel.
09:03:33.539 Satoru and Takumi areable to visualize
09:03:36.000 what the shape of thefinal club will look like,
09:03:38.419 but they can'tsee everything.
09:03:40.629 For this, Honmaneeds to bring in
09:03:42.965 a different kind of expert.
09:03:59.690 Narrator: CAD, orcomputer-aided design,
09:04:02.026 allows specialists todesign the parts of a club
09:04:04.737 that a human cannotsee on the outside.
09:04:07.948 CAD creates a 3D scan ofthe head of the club.
09:04:11.368 Then specialistswill determine
09:04:13.203 the thickness of carbonand titanium needed
09:04:15.789 and run simulations totest the club's integrity.
09:04:36.935 Narrator: Meanwhile,in a different part
09:04:38.562 of the Sakata factory,
09:04:40.272 craftspeople createthe clubs' shafts.
09:04:43.525 And while othergolf-club manufacturers
09:04:45.527 often outsource the shaft,
09:04:47.571 Honma makes every oneof theirs in-house.
09:04:59.875 Narrator: The shaftsof the Beres clubs
09:05:01.585 are designed to recoveras quickly as possible
09:05:03.796 to their originalshape after swinging.
09:05:07.758 The shaft begins witha strong material
09:05:10.219 called high-moduluscarbon fiber.
09:05:13.597 This is the highestgrade of carbon fiber,
09:05:16.100 often used to makeprofessional racing bicycles.
09:05:20.604 This is cut andwrapped around
09:05:22.022 a metal rodcalled a mandrel.
09:05:50.759 Narrator: Even at thisstage of the process,
09:05:52.803 the handmade elements of designare highly customizable.
09:06:14.992 Narrator: And an experthuman eye is required
09:06:17.076 for every last detail,including the paint.
09:06:35.845 Narrator: Honma invented itsvery own pull-through method
09:06:38.390 for this step, a unique skillthat allows craftspeople
09:06:41.852 to have total controlover the outcome
09:06:44.188 of the shaft's appearance.
09:07:06.000 Narrator: This method isn'tall about looks, either.
09:07:22.809 Narrator: Once everylast detail of the club
09:07:24.478 is perfected, thereis one more step
09:07:27.021 that must bedone just right.
09:07:29.483 If the assembly goes wrong,
09:07:31.400 the work of the previousmaster craftsmen
09:07:33.654 could be for nothing.
09:08:03.767 Narrator: When ashaft is complete,
09:08:05.434 it is balanced andtested to make sure
09:08:07.771 that the spine, orstiff inner core,
09:08:10.273 is set to a 6-o'clockangle on every club.
09:08:13.902 But there's still roomfor customization
09:08:16.280 up until the very end.
09:08:43.724 Narrator: To make sure themeasurements are exactly right,
09:08:46.309 Honma uses a robotic armto test out their clubs.
09:08:58.572 Narrator: Honma Golfstarted in 1958
09:09:01.283 as a driving range inTsurumi, Yokohama.
09:09:04.244 After that time, most of thegolf clubs sold in Japan
09:09:07.497 were foreign clubs.
09:09:09.708 In 1982, they startedmanufacturing their own clubs
09:09:13.127 at the Sakata factory inresponse to domestic demand.
09:09:34.148 Narrator: Around 2015, Honmamade a push for popularity
09:09:37.778 in the NorthAmerican market.
09:09:39.780 But the company'sclientele in Japan
09:09:41.864 will always havethe added advantage
09:09:44.576 of customizing clubsat the Sakata factory.
09:09:47.703 And Japan's progolfers know it well.
09:10:07.349 Narrator: The buttonson this accordion
09:10:09.351 are made frommother-of-pearl,
09:10:11.478 the inner lining ofcertain seashells.
09:10:14.146 For a full-sized accordionwith more than 100 buttons,
09:10:17.858 Pigini spends about 600euros on this part alone.
09:10:22.739 That's four times the cost
09:10:24.491 of acrylic buttons onstandard accordions.
09:10:27.494 This attention to materialsis why Pigini accordions
09:10:31.498 can sell for nearly40,000 euros.
09:10:34.917 But do Pigini accordionssound any different?
09:10:38.046 And why else arethey so expensive?
09:10:46.303 The Italian townof Castelfidardo
09:10:49.016 is known as the accordioncapital of the world, and here,
09:10:53.019 Pigini makes some of the world'smost expensive accordions.
09:10:58.066 Like the one playedby Ludovica Borsatti,
09:11:00.652 who swears by Piginiaccordions for their sound.
09:11:03.612 Really, mechanically,they are perfect,
09:11:05.449 and they are really,really, really complex.
09:11:07.909 Narrator: While allaccordions have three
09:11:09.286 basic components —
09:11:10.746 keys or buttons on theright and left sides
09:11:12.956 and bellows in the middle —
09:11:14.665 most Pigini accordions havea lot of individual parts:
09:11:18.252 over 12,000.
09:11:20.213 Each one is necessary forcreating a richer sound,
09:11:23.591 according to theItalian brand.
09:11:26.218 And they're made with high-qualityand expensive materials.
09:12:02.881 Narrator: Take those expensivebuttons for example.
09:12:05.759 According to Adriano,
09:12:07.260 a master craftsman atPigini for over 50 years,
09:12:10.347 the company usesmother-of-pearl
09:12:12.224 because it doesn't getsticky or slippery
09:12:14.559 and it stays cool, evenafter hours of playing.
09:12:20.607 While the buttons improvethe playing experience,
09:12:23.527 the wood used on a Piginiis what impacts the sound.
09:12:35.288 Narrator: To achievethis, Pigini uses
09:12:36.998 a secret combinationof wood.
09:12:39.875 And though the company won'treveal the exact blend,
09:12:43.004 it includes mahogany,maple, and cedar.
09:12:46.925 But these don't come cheap:
09:12:49.093 Pigini says a squaremeter of cedar alone
09:12:51.763 costs almost 5,000 euros.
09:12:54.766 And it's not just aboutthe right blend of woods,
09:12:57.059 but how the wood is cut.
09:12:59.311 If it's not asstraight as possible
09:13:01.439 and the grainsare interrupted,
09:13:03.358 the sound it producesisn't as rich.
09:13:07.946 When it comes to the12,000 different parts,
09:13:10.824 Pigini is meticulous,
09:13:12.826 even down to the glue thatholds it all together.
09:13:15.620 The company prefers not touse generic vinyl glues
09:13:18.790 because they'rewater-based and rubbery,
09:13:20.750 which would dampen theaccordion's sound.
09:13:40.478 Narrator: Higher-qualitymaterials come at a higher cost.
09:13:43.607 But this isn'tthe only reason
09:13:45.108 Pigini accordionsare expensive.
09:13:47.527 Adriano says it's the costof labor that ups the price.
09:13:51.781 From the mother-of-pearl buttonsto the reeds and levers,
09:13:55.035 the thousands of piecesin each accordion
09:13:57.453 are carefullyinstalled by hand.
09:13:59.623 Each slat is made byhand, shaved by hand,
09:14:02.375 and nailed by hand.
09:14:04.169 The wood and leatherskin are glued by hand.
09:14:19.226 Narrator: The metal partson the left side alone
09:14:21.394 take over 60 hours toinstall correctly.
09:14:24.521 That's at least a week ofwork for a single element.
09:14:28.443 That's why completing anaccordion like the Pigini Nòva
09:14:32.030 takes over a year.
09:14:34.407 And only 20 aremade each year.
09:14:38.495 But according to Pigini, tuningis one of the hardest parts.
09:14:42.915 Tuning a smaller accordioncan take only a few hours,
09:14:46.086 but larger, morecomplex models
09:14:48.254 take up to 30 hoursfor the reeds alone.
09:14:51.091 It starts with this robot armPigini bought and reprogrammed
09:14:54.761 to test the tongueson these metal reeds.
09:14:58.765 The accordion produces sound
09:15:00.432 when air passes through thethin tongues of the reeds,
09:15:04.436 and there are over 500 reedsin a free-bass accordion.
09:15:08.023 That's over 1,000 notes thathave to be tuned to perfection.
09:15:12.362 The reeds arethen installed,
09:15:14.239 and the notes areretuned by hand
09:15:15.739 by one of four experttuners, like Lorenzo.
09:15:19.076 He lifts each tongue
09:15:20.453 to make sure air can move aroundit freely when it's played.
09:15:24.708 He also adjusts bothsides of each reed
09:15:27.460 to ensure they're on key.
09:15:29.629 And once the accordionis fully assembled,
09:15:31.964 retuning can takeup to a month.
09:15:34.634 That's intensive compared tothe couple of hours it takes
09:15:37.637 to retune a piano.
09:15:39.222 Another reason theseaccordions cost so much
09:15:41.516 is because of the brand'shistoric reputation
09:15:43.977 as an innovator.
09:15:55.530 Narrator: Meaning most ofits accordions are built
09:15:57.657 to play both bass notes andmelodies at the same time.
09:16:01.953 The more common Stradellabass system plays bass notes
09:16:05.165 with only a few chordoptions for melodies.
09:16:08.417 The free-bass accordion,on the other hand,
09:16:10.712 can play various melodiesin the right and left hands
09:16:13.964 along with bass notes.
09:16:15.966 Pigini achievedthis by developing
09:16:17.927 a more complex model fora converter in 1961.
09:16:22.223 Its converter expanded theaccordion's sound capabilities
09:16:26.019 but didn't make theinstrument any heavier.
09:16:50.377 Narrator: It's also themost expensive part
09:16:52.462 of Pigini's free-bassaccordions.
09:16:54.506 The converter, along withthe cost of installing it,
09:16:57.384 accounts for almost a thirdof an accordion's price.
09:17:00.220 Other companies have triedreplicating its mechanics,
09:17:02.889 because in theaccordion world,
09:17:04.557 the lighter an instrument, thebetter it is for musicians,
09:17:07.394 and the more notes anaccordion can play,
09:17:09.561 the more valuable it is.
09:17:31.792 Narrator: Thatgoes a long way
09:17:32.961 for advanced accordionists,like Ludovica,
09:17:35.629 who believe the accordionistis only as good
09:17:38.383 as the instrument they play.
09:17:41.761 I choose Pigini alsofor another reason,
09:17:44.555 maybe the mostimportant one,
09:17:47.057 and it's because of the soundthese instruments have.
09:17:51.186 It's really a uniqueand pure sound.
09:17:54.773 It's always so elegant.
09:17:57.110 And really, I feel it is thereal sound of the accordion,
09:18:01.781 the classical accordion,
09:18:02.949 which is the instrument I fallin love and I want to play.
09:18:12.417 Bonsai is an art form
09:18:13.750 that requires years of trainingand centuries of dedication.
09:18:20.466 At the 2012 internationalbonsai convention,
09:18:23.428 a tree was on sale for 100 million yen,
09:18:26.097 just under a million dollars.
09:18:28.432 And many more of these trees
09:18:29.642 are considered completely priceless.
09:18:32.394 So what is it that makesbonsai so expensive?
09:18:42.947 Bonsai is the art ofdwarfing a regular tree
09:18:45.449 to create a perfect miniaturerepresentation of nature
09:18:48.161 in a small pot.
09:18:50.455 It has a long history.
09:18:52.290 Originating in China,
09:18:53.540 the practice of creating tiny trees
09:18:55.250 and landscapes appeared asfar back as the sixth century.
09:18:59.964 The tree's growth is restricted
09:19:01.424 by years of pruning, wiring,repotting, and grafting,
09:19:04.802 and the plants need to be checked on
09:19:06.470 and often watered every day.
09:19:09.432 The skills required to grow these trees
09:19:11.309 plays a huge part in their value.
09:19:13.061 They're often bent and twisted into shape,
09:19:15.480 positioned around rocks,
09:19:16.731 or even placed with other treesto simulate a tiny forest.
09:19:22.070 Many of these techniquesrequire years to master,
09:19:24.656 and any errors made
09:19:25.615 can result in permanentlyruining the shape
09:19:27.784 or even killing a plant thathas been growing for centuries.
09:19:32.330 Chiako Yamamoto is afourth-generation bonsai master
09:19:35.416 based in central Japan.
09:19:37.210 She's been creating and selling bonsai
09:19:38.836 for the last 51 years,
09:19:40.588 and one of the hardest skills to master
09:19:42.298 when growing these plants is patience.
09:20:48.364 The time and devotionthis process requires
09:20:50.241 is unlike almost anyother form of artwork.
09:20:54.203 While the work is almosta form of sculpture,
09:20:56.331 the plants are living things
09:20:57.582 and will always react in their own way.
09:21:37.246 The extraordinary timethis process takes means
09:21:39.582 that just aren't that many trees around.
09:21:43.002 Some of the most valuablebonsai are over 800 years old,
09:21:46.339 and so the supply isn't goingto increase anytime soon.
09:22:28.381 Other factors can contribute to the cost.
09:22:30.591 The bonsai pots and thetools used are often handmade
09:22:33.594 and can cost thousandsof dollars themselves.
09:22:37.014 Certain types of treeare also harder to grow
09:22:39.350 or require certain techniquesand may fetch a higher price.
09:22:43.730 But, more than anything,these trees are works of art
09:22:46.858 valued for their beauty andthe vision of the artist.
09:23:51.172 Luxury cousins of the mushroom,
09:23:53.090 truffles are an indulgentfood enjoyed across the world.
09:23:57.011 But these fragrant fungi will cost you.
09:23:59.514 In 2014, the world's largestwhite truffle was flown
09:24:03.351 to New York accompaniedby a security guard
09:24:06.229 and sold at auction for $61,000.
09:24:09.524 Discovered in Italy, this gigantic fungus
09:24:12.485 weighed almost 2 kilos.
09:24:14.320 So, what is it thatmakes them so expensive?
09:24:22.453 There are a lot of types of truffle.
09:24:24.747 There are at least 40 species,many of which aren't edible,
09:24:28.167 and new species have beendiscovered as recently as 2018.
09:24:32.380 You've probably seenluxury truffle products
09:24:34.382 in supermarkets or fancy restaurants,
09:24:37.176 but the unique truffleflavor you recognize
09:24:39.512 might not be real truffle at all.
09:24:41.764 Cheap truffle oil often hasn't been
09:24:43.349 anywhere near a real truffle.
09:24:45.601 Many cheaper truffle productsuse 2,4-dithiapentane,
09:24:49.605 a synthesized compound containing one
09:24:52.024 of the main aromaticcomponents of foot odor,
09:24:55.027 guaranteed to give it that "earthy" taste.
09:24:57.697 Real truffles are seasonal and pricey,
09:24:59.991 with a short shelf life.
09:25:02.118 They were originally sniffedout using truffle pigs,
09:25:04.829 but while pigs are verygood at finding truffles,
09:25:07.123 they're also very goodat eating them, too.
09:25:09.250 And these days, dogs are much more common
09:25:11.419 truffle-hunting companions.
09:25:13.671 These fungi can be found across the world,
09:25:16.215 but they all require a veryspecific climate to grow.
09:25:20.011 While different varieties may have
09:25:21.596 somewhat different requirements,one thing is certain.
09:25:24.724 You can't have truffles without trees.
09:25:27.143 James Feaver: Truffles arealways found with trees,
09:25:29.562 and they have to be theright type of trees.
09:25:31.606 Under the ground, the truffleis just the fruiting body,
09:25:36.235 so an equivalent to an apple.
09:25:37.862 And we've also got alot of then what we call
09:25:39.989 the mycelium, microscopic-level threads,
09:25:42.700 and up to 100 metersin a teaspoon of soil.
09:25:45.745 And this mycelium is actuallyattached to the roots
09:25:48.998 of a tree like the fingersof glove onto a hand.
09:25:52.627 And it sort of extendsthe reach of the tree out.
09:25:55.671 And it actually takesup water and nutrients
09:25:58.090 and passes them to the tree,and the tree gives it sugars
09:26:00.801 in return, so to help thetruffles, the fruit, develop.
09:26:05.222 Narrator: Even when you haveexactly the right conditions,
09:26:07.600 truffles aren't guaranteed,
09:26:09.393 and hunting them is alabor-intensive process.
09:26:12.480 Once you know where tolook, you have to sniff out
09:26:15.066 and dig up each truffle by hand,
09:26:17.234 and they can be tricky to find.
09:26:22.406 Feaver: Good boy, thankyou, good boy, come!
09:26:25.743 So he just told us thereit's still in the ground.
09:26:28.329 So do I want to take itout of the ground or not?
09:26:31.499 It all depends on if it's ripe.
09:26:32.708 If it's unripe, there'sno point in having it.
09:26:35.836 So the nose comes into play.
09:26:37.755 And we actually sniff the ground for it.
09:26:48.641 Narrator: It may take a while,
09:26:49.850 but finding a good one canmake it worth the work.
09:26:54.397 Feaver: Yeah, that's a nice one.
09:26:57.316 Yeah, that's probably about
09:27:00.736 70, 80 grams.
09:27:04.073 Narrator: Truffles alsohave a short season,
09:27:06.283 often appearing for onlya few months of the year.
09:27:09.370 And even when you doget your hands on them,
09:27:11.163 they don't last for long.
09:27:14.417 Feaver: An unripetruffle, unlike a tomato,
09:27:17.545 which you could cut from the vine
09:27:19.463 and ripen on your windowsill,
09:27:20.881 once the truffle is out of theground, the clock is ticking.
09:27:24.135 So it's just sort of slowlygonna degrade over time.
09:27:26.971 So we want to get it out tothe customers nice and fast.
09:27:30.766 Narrator: After just fivedays out of the ground,
09:27:32.810 that pungent trufflesmell will have halved.
09:27:36.564 You can farm many truffle varieties,
09:27:38.899 besides the rare Italian whites.
09:27:41.360 Many people have been successful
09:27:42.737 in setting up truffleorchards, but it's not easy.
09:27:46.866 Trees need to be planted inthe right soil conditions,
09:27:49.535 inoculated with truffle fungus,
09:27:51.412 and often irrigated constantly.
09:27:54.040 It can take as long as six years
09:27:55.666 before you get a good truffle harvest,
09:27:57.543 and there's no guarantee thatthe fungi will grow at all.
09:28:00.755 So after all that effort, whatdo they actually taste like?
09:28:05.551 Ju Shardlow: Ooh.
09:28:06.969 Claudia Romeo: Hm.
09:28:08.763 Leon Siciliano: Thesmell just made me think
09:28:10.765 it was gonna be really strong.
09:28:12.808 The flavor is actually quite subtle.
09:28:15.686 There's a nuttiness there.
09:28:17.188 There's, like, an earthy flavor there.
09:28:20.191 Ju: Actually quite light and fragrant.
09:28:22.651 It tastes a lot nicer than it smells.
09:28:24.570 It smells like damp socks.
09:28:26.697 Claudia: That's good.
09:28:27.823 I mean, this is the firsttime I've actually eaten
09:28:29.408 a truffle by itself.
09:28:30.910 You know, it's a bit like mushroom,
09:28:32.495 but it's more of a meaty, meaty bite.
09:28:37.333 Narrator: These days,farming has taken over
09:28:39.210 as our primary source of truffles,
09:28:41.045 and today, 70% of the world'struffles are cultivated.
09:28:44.965 Through the loss ofwoodland and climate change,
09:28:47.301 the number of wild truffleshas decreased significantly.
09:28:50.554 Since the 19th century,production in France has fallen
09:28:53.599 from over 1,000 tonnes aseason to just 30 tonnes.
09:28:57.353 And climate change could meanthat truffles will disappear
09:29:00.064 altogether in the future.
09:29:01.982 Feaver: The weatherconditions are so important,
09:29:03.609 not just immediately,over the whole season.
09:29:06.153 We're getting much lower numbers
09:29:08.739 and much lower average size.
09:29:10.282 A truffle is about 70% water,
09:29:12.451 so it needs rainfall to help it grow.
09:29:14.453 Some UK truffle scientists are thinking
09:29:17.414 that your traditional areas,
09:29:19.708 the climate is gonna move further north,
09:29:22.419 and they're not gonnahave a truffle industry
09:29:24.338 within I think perhaps 50 years.
09:29:27.133 There's threats, there's opportunities,
09:29:28.551 but rain, we do need rain.
09:29:30.427 When we get a dry summer,
09:29:31.887 the holidaymakers, they're delighted,
09:29:33.430 but I keep crossing my fingers
09:29:34.932 for a bit of rain every now and again.
09:29:41.480 Making a Series 7 kolinsky sable
09:29:43.858 watercolor brush isn't easy.
09:29:46.610 The largest-size brush can take
09:29:48.404 almost a week and a half to make.
09:29:51.198 You can pick up a cheap, synthetic
09:29:52.950 brush for under $2,
09:29:55.119 but a Series 7 could cost you over $300.
09:29:58.998 So why would anyone pay for a brush
09:30:00.833 that costs over 100 times the price?
09:30:09.925 Originally created on the request
09:30:11.635 of Queen Victoria, the Series 7 brush
09:30:14.430 was first made in 1866
09:30:17.266 and was designed to be the
09:30:18.517 finest possible brushfor watercolor painting.
09:30:22.313 Since then, the skill and craftsmanship
09:30:25.024 that goes into makingeach one of these brushes
09:30:27.651 has remained exactly the same.
09:30:30.321 To achieve this, the company needed
09:30:32.198 skilled brush makers.
09:30:34.158 And so, in 1946, set up a new factory
09:30:37.745 in Lowestoft, England,
09:30:39.580 a fishing town with ahistory of rope making.
09:30:42.750 This factory now makes over
09:30:44.251 25 million brushes a year.
09:30:47.713 The intricate work and dexterity
09:30:49.423 required means that these brushes
09:30:51.383 are almost exclusively made by women.
09:30:53.969 It takes three years to train,
09:30:56.013 and there are only nine brush makers
09:30:57.556 in the world that can make these
09:30:59.141 top-of-the-range Series 7 brushes.
09:31:02.436 Sandra Harris: I joinedhere when I was 16.
09:31:04.563 I worked 18 years,
09:31:06.440 and I had 12 years off,and I've been back 11,
09:31:08.484 so that's 28 years I've been working
09:31:10.736 for the company.
09:31:11.904 When you first start, you would
09:31:13.072 probably only make a few.
09:31:14.573 You've got to get, like anything,
09:31:16.325 you've got a skill and you build on that,
09:31:18.035 and you get to learn the skill,
09:31:19.662 and then you get to do the speed.
09:31:23.249 Narrator: The components play a big part
09:31:24.708 in the cost.
09:31:25.918 Each brush head is madefrom kolinsky sable,
09:31:28.921 a Siberian weasel that'shair is said to cost
09:31:31.674 three times the price of gold by weight.
09:31:34.510 These weasels are hunted sustainably
09:31:36.512 every spring under CITES guidelines
09:31:39.181 across Siberia and Manchuria.
09:31:41.350 Only guard hairs from the tail will do.
09:31:44.395 Kolinsky hairs are chosen because
09:31:46.230 every single strand has a surface of
09:31:48.232 directional, interlocking scales,
09:31:50.734 increasing the surface area and giving
09:31:52.569 the hairs their strength.
09:31:54.363 And while many other natural and synthetic
09:31:56.407 hairs are used for brushes,
09:31:58.325 nothing has quite matched
09:31:59.451 the quality of sable.
09:32:03.455 Once the hairs are cleaned and graded,
09:32:05.457 it's time to start making the brush.
09:32:08.502 The wool has to be removed with a comb,
09:32:10.671 and the hairs are packaged up
09:32:12.089 and carefully boiled and ironed.
09:32:16.051 The brushes have to be made with hair
09:32:17.678 at its natural length.
09:32:20.347 And the skilled brush makers can
09:32:21.849 effortlessly separate between
09:32:23.684 28- and 32-millimeter-length hairs
09:32:26.520 just with their hands.
09:32:30.149 This skill takes yearsof training and practice.
09:32:33.694 The nine brush makers each have 27 years
09:32:36.488 of experience, on average.
09:32:39.742 Hairs that are blunt or twisted
09:32:41.118 have to be discarded.
09:32:42.536 And most importantly,
09:32:43.996 as each natural hair comes to a point,
09:32:46.540 every hair must be the correct way up.
09:32:50.502 The removed upside-down hairs
09:32:52.129 can be flipped and reused.
09:32:58.510 Every single hair is checked over by hand.
09:33:01.764 The smallest-brush-size hairs
09:33:03.098 are just 7 millimeters long,
09:33:05.100 shorter than an average eyelash.
09:33:07.394 Shane Buckingham: We can't afford to let
09:33:09.396 standards drop in any way, shape, or form.
09:33:12.149 What I would say from that is
09:33:13.901 what this factory has is hand skills.
09:33:17.905 It has individual skills.
09:33:19.907 It has skills that,
09:33:21.909 when I have new people come in here,
09:33:25.621 they don't sometimes believe
09:33:27.539 that this kind of work still happens.
09:33:30.250 We show them what people do,
09:33:32.836 they will turn round and say,
09:33:33.962 "I'll never be able to do that."
09:33:36.006 But they will be able to do that
09:33:37.966 if they understand thatquality comes first.
09:33:43.263 Narrator: When the hairs are all sorted,
09:33:44.890 they're ready to go into the cannon.
09:33:47.101 The bundle is tied together
09:33:48.602 and gently twisted through.
09:33:51.563 Individual hairs are added or taken away
09:33:53.899 until it's an exact fit.
09:33:57.236 Buckingham: They needto have that fine point
09:33:59.446 to work with, that, basically,
09:34:01.698 it has that color-carrying capacity.
09:34:04.243 That the brush won't split or do anything
09:34:07.704 that it shouldn't do, basically.
09:34:09.998 Through the hair that we use,
09:34:12.418 through the skills of our makers
09:34:14.086 and how they make them,
09:34:15.504 we've done everything we possibly can
09:34:17.798 to make sure that we have produced
09:34:20.092 the best product we possibly can.
09:34:25.222 Narrator: Then, it's time to attach
09:34:26.432 the handles.
09:34:28.142 The factory uses birch wood handles
09:34:29.977 imported from Italy.
09:34:32.312 The brush is glued into place, and then
09:34:34.690 the brush heads arecrimped onto the handles.
09:34:39.236 This crimping process bends the metal
09:34:41.155 to shape and keeps the handle
09:34:42.698 tightly attached to the brush.
09:34:46.118 Once the paintbrush is assembled,
09:34:47.870 it needs to be branded and tested.
09:34:51.415 The size and logo of each brush
09:34:53.250 is stamped in gold on the handle.
09:34:56.837 Wet-point testing assures that everything
09:34:58.755 works exactly as expected
09:35:00.507 and there aren't anyloose or crooked hairs.
09:35:05.471 Each brush is then gummed, a process
09:35:08.015 that gives the brush head its final shape
09:35:10.517 and allows it to bounce back.
09:35:12.728 The shape of the natural hairs
09:35:14.188 gives the brush a wide belly
09:35:15.856 and a fine point.
09:35:18.817 Mark Brindle: So, thekey to our brush making
09:35:20.486 is the people.
09:35:21.820 And that is the skill.
09:35:23.614 We retain knowledge
09:35:25.032 from generation to generation.
09:35:27.326 So, we have makers now that are working
09:35:30.746 under an apprenticeship of
09:35:33.624 a 49-year-served brush maker,
09:35:36.710 who himself had an apprenticeship under
09:35:39.755 another 49-year-serving brush maker,
09:35:43.425 who was brought into the business
09:35:45.844 under his father, who made brushes
09:35:48.096 directly for Queen Victoria.
09:35:50.057 And it's very key that we retain
09:35:51.683 that knowledge throughout the business,
09:35:54.895 generation to generation, and we are now
09:35:56.813 bringing in the nextgeneration to make sure
09:35:58.649 that we uphold the very high-quality
09:36:00.817 standards that we base ourselves on.
09:36:10.452 Narrator: This is pink Himalayan salt.
09:36:13.080 It may look pretty, but a pinchof this stuff will cost you,
09:36:16.583 and 100 grams of pink Himalayan salt
09:36:18.794 can cost up to 20 times theprice of generic table salt.
09:36:22.089 So why is it so expensive?
09:36:31.473 Pink Himalayan salt hasgathered a cult following.
09:36:33.725 Its supporters claim thatit helps with everything
09:36:35.894 from weight loss, reducingaging, regulating sleep,
09:36:38.939 and even increasing your libido.
09:36:40.732 And while the pink saltitself can cost $10 per kilo,
09:36:44.194 the products made using itcan be far more expensive.
09:36:47.406 But what actually is the difference
09:36:48.824 between types of salt,
09:36:50.117 and where have these claims come from?
09:36:54.621 To get an idea of what makespink Himalayan salt different,
09:36:57.749 we need to look at the different types
09:36:59.126 of salt in the industry.
09:37:00.836 Table salt is often made
09:37:02.129 by drilling into underground seabeds,
09:37:04.006 pumping out the saltwater,
09:37:06.049 and then refining itin purification plants.
09:37:08.719 Natural minerals like magnesiumor potassium are taken away.
09:37:13.557 Sea salt is made by evaporating seawater
09:37:15.726 using the sun or indoor heaters.
09:37:18.478 Unlike table salt, it normallyhas no extra chemicals added,
09:37:21.732 and its natural minerals stay intact.
09:37:24.234 Rock salt is different.
09:37:25.819 In certain regions of the world,
09:37:27.487 buried hundreds of feet below the ground,
09:37:29.281 are the remains of evaporated seas.
09:37:31.992 This mineral, halite, gets harvested
09:37:34.161 by drilling the rockface, crushing the salt,
09:37:36.371 and splintering it into pieces.
09:37:39.124 Pink salt can only befound in very few places,
09:37:41.710 from the Murray River in Australia
09:37:43.295 to Maras in Peru,
09:37:44.963 but the supply is far from limited.
09:37:47.424 The majority of pinksalt mines in the world
09:37:49.217 are in Pakistan, at thebase of the Himalayas,
09:37:52.137 and the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan
09:37:53.805 produces 350,000 tons per year.
09:37:58.018 So is pink salt healthier?
09:38:01.021 The salt has an estimated84 different minerals in it,
09:38:03.774 which give it its pink color.
09:38:05.942 But these minerals only makeup around 2% of the salt.
09:38:09.446 So apparently, it's reportedyou can get around 84
09:38:12.908 different trace mineral elements.
09:38:15.661 However, it's such a verysmall percentage of the salt
09:38:19.790 that makes up these minerals
09:38:21.458 that you are highly unlikelyto get any real benefit
09:38:24.586 or any trace of them in yourregular serving of salt itself,
09:38:29.299 and I hate to be the bearerof disappointing news,
09:38:31.927 but it's pretty similar, nutritionally.
09:38:36.390 Narrator: Pink salt's supposed benefits
09:38:37.849 aren't just about eating it though,
09:38:39.768 and many people claim ithas healing properties
09:38:42.187 when either inhaled oreven when used as a lamp.
09:38:45.482 Rhiannon: I can see why trends come about.
09:38:47.859 So for instance, there's a lot
09:38:49.820 of different homeopathic remedies
09:38:51.655 that can seem very, very appealing,
09:38:53.782 but actually because they'renot grounded in evidence
09:38:56.702 a lot of the time, a small hint
09:38:59.246 of something having a promise
09:39:00.956 can get blown out of proportion,
09:39:02.582 especially when it comes to the media,
09:39:04.209 especially in terms ofbeautiful-looking items,
09:39:08.130 and I think pink salt ofcourse is a lot more appealing
09:39:11.299 for a lot of people
09:39:12.676 when you compare it toyour regular white salt.
09:39:17.514 Narrator: So Himalayan salt doesn't have
09:39:18.765 the health benefits claimed,
09:39:20.434 but it's still marketed as a luxury salt,
09:39:22.686 and global salt consumption is forecast
09:39:24.396 to be worth $14.1 billion by 2020.
09:39:27.774 So does it taste any better for the price?
09:39:33.989 I think it tastes nicer,
09:39:35.407 but I don't know if Ijust think it tastes nicer
09:39:37.492 because I know it's meant to taste nicer.
09:39:41.872 It doesn't taste that different.
09:39:44.458 It's a bit less harsh on the palate.
09:39:47.252 It doesn't sort of burnyour tongue as much,
09:39:49.379 which I guess is a good thing.
09:39:50.714 I couldn't really telltoo much of a difference
09:39:52.299 between them to be honest.
09:39:53.300 If I was cooking with them,
09:39:54.676 putting them in a dish,
09:39:55.927 I probably wouldn't be able
09:39:56.762 to tell the difference between them.
09:39:58.221 It just kinda tastes like salt.
09:40:02.559 Narrator: There's one other big thing
09:40:03.602 that's led to pink salt'spopularity: Instagram.
09:40:07.063 It's because Instagram isan image-based platform,
09:40:09.733 so if you think about it,
09:40:11.651 it's more attractive totake pictures of something
09:40:14.154 that's pink naturally orsomething that's bright green.
09:40:17.365 It's more, I would callit, aesthetic food.
09:40:20.786 So looking at how food appears
09:40:23.330 rather than it being a miracle benefit,
09:40:26.875 and I think if you are lookingat social media on a whole,
09:40:30.796 it goes in seasons, and it goes in
09:40:32.923 whatever is the most photographed item.
09:40:35.217 I don't think it will be around forever.
09:40:47.604 Avocado has become one ofthe world's trendiest foods.
09:40:51.274 As the poster child ofmillennial healthy eating,
09:40:53.985 this superfood is now amainstay for foodies everywhere.
09:40:57.739 But have you noticed your avo on toast
09:40:59.533 is costing more and more?
09:41:02.035 Avocado prices have rocketedin recent years by up to 129%,
09:41:06.832 with the average nationalprice of a single Hass avocado
09:41:09.793 reaching $2.10 in 2019, almostdoubling in just one year.
09:41:16.341 So, why are avocados so expensive?
09:41:22.264 Archaeologists in Peru havefound domesticated avocado seeds
09:41:25.767 buried with Incan mummiesdating back to 750 BC.
09:41:30.272 But it was the Aztecs in 500BC who named it āhuacatl,
09:41:33.900 which translates to "testicle."
09:41:37.487 When Spanish conquistadorsswept through Mexico
09:41:39.823 and Central America in the 16th century,
09:41:42.158 they renamed it aguacate.
09:41:44.035 The farming of aguacate developed
09:41:45.787 over the next few hundred years,
09:41:47.414 predominantly in CentralAmerica and South America.
09:41:50.292 But consumption of the "alligator pear"
09:41:52.085 outside of these regionsbefore the late 19th century
09:41:55.213 was almost nonexistent.
09:41:57.215 The commercialization ofaguacate began in the early 1900s
09:42:01.344 but was focused on brandingavocados as a delicacy
09:42:04.222 for the wealthy, like thisadvert in The New Yorker
09:42:07.017 from 1920, which declared them as
09:42:09.144 "The aristocrat of salad fruit."
09:42:11.313 But a selection ofCalifornian growers realized
09:42:14.065 that the hard-to-pronounceaguacate was off-putting
09:42:16.818 for the mass market, so they formed
09:42:18.987 the California Avocado Association.
09:42:21.489 By the 1950s, production scale grew,
09:42:24.075 and avocado prices fellto about 25 cents each.
09:42:27.913 Popularity increased further with the wave
09:42:30.165 of inter-American immigration in the '60s,
09:42:32.709 as Latin Americans broughttheir love of avocados
09:42:34.961 with them to the US.
09:42:37.172 But as demand increased,supply had to keep up,
09:42:40.133 and the true difficultiesof yielding large-scale
09:42:42.552 avocado crops began to show.
09:42:45.096 Avocado orchards requirean extraordinary amount
09:42:47.515 of costly resources in order to flourish.
09:42:50.352 Gus Gunderson: There are multiple inputs
09:42:51.895 that avocados require,
09:42:53.521 whether it's water, fertilizer,pruning, pest control,
09:42:56.691 the sunburn protection of trees.
09:42:58.902 All those go into makingyour chances better
09:43:01.154 of having a very good-quality crop.
09:43:03.823 When we decide to plantan avocado orchard,
09:43:05.951 we'll plant trees that comefrom certified nurseries.
09:43:09.287 We have to place ourorders years in advance.
09:43:12.791 On average, if we're producing100,000 pounds per acre,
09:43:16.753 that takes about amillion gallons of water,
09:43:18.880 so 100 gallons per pound,
09:43:21.466 so it'd be about 50gallons per 8-ounce fruit.
09:43:24.094 But that's dependent on what mother nature
09:43:26.429 will throw at you, you know, we have wind,
09:43:28.515 we have intense sun.
09:43:29.766 It's really hard for a grower to manage
09:43:33.019 the unmanageable thingsthat will affect a crop.
09:43:37.732 Narrator: The surge inpopularity of avocados
09:43:39.734 stalled during the fat-fightingfrenzy of the 1980s,
09:43:43.154 with an average of only 1 pound per capita
09:43:45.365 being consumed in America by 1989.
09:43:48.118 The decade's low-fatobsession drove consumers
09:43:50.787 away from avocado becauseof its high fat content,
09:43:53.540 without really understanding
09:43:54.916 the nutritional truth hidden within.
09:43:57.419 Hazel Wallace: When it comesto fat in food in general,
09:43:59.671 people tend to get a little bit concerned
09:44:01.589 because we often hear in the media
09:44:02.966 that fat isn't good for us.
09:44:04.634 But the type of fat that's in avocados
09:44:06.469 is monounsaturated fat, whichis actually often deemed
09:44:09.889 healthy fat or heart-healthy fat,
09:44:11.975 so while there is alot of fat in avocados,
09:44:14.978 it's actually quite good fat.
09:44:16.980 Narrator: Avocado startedits meteoric comeback
09:44:19.232 at the turn of themillennium, and it was helped
09:44:21.234 by an unlikely political decision.
09:44:23.695 In 2005, the US Department of Agriculture
09:44:26.906 lifted a 90-year-old banto allow the importation
09:44:29.909 of Mexican avocados to all 50 states.
09:44:32.829 Initially, this decisionangered Californian growers,
09:44:35.665 who feared the move couldslash local growers' sales
09:44:38.043 by as much as 20%.
09:44:40.003 Harold Edwards: What actuallyhad transpired and took place
09:44:42.088 was, as that Mexicansupply became much more
09:44:45.508 prevalent and available,retailers got behind
09:44:49.179 marketing and selling avocados,
09:44:51.056 food service providers,restaurants started putting it
09:44:53.516 as permanent parts of their menus,
09:44:56.102 and demand started to boom
09:44:57.896 because the inconsistentsupply chains before
09:45:01.066 were now consistent, andconsumers were allowed
09:45:03.610 to enjoy avocados every day of the year.
09:45:06.529 Narrator: The biggest dayof the avocado calendar
09:45:08.573 became Super Bowl Sunday,when it's now estimated
09:45:11.409 that almost 200 million pounds of avocados
09:45:14.037 are eaten during the big game in America.
09:45:16.581 But if you take a moment to consider
09:45:18.166 the resources neededto produce that amount,
09:45:21.252 you can start to understandavocados' elevated prices.
09:45:24.714 According to experts, it takesroughly 270 liters of water
09:45:28.551 to grow a pound of avocados.
09:45:30.178 So 200 million pounds could require
09:45:32.472 as much as 54 billion liters of water,
09:45:35.225 which means droughtsor heat waves can have
09:45:37.352 devastating consequenceson the avocado industry.
09:45:41.272 In fact, that's exactly what'sbeen happening in California
09:45:44.359 for the last seven years,with the Sunshine State
09:45:47.153 only recently being declareddrought-free in 2019,
09:45:51.116 which goes a long way toexplaining record avocado prices.
09:45:55.370 In some countries, likeChile, avocado cultivation
09:45:58.373 is being blamed for exacerbating droughts,
09:46:00.792 as lush green orchardsoverlook dry riverbeds.
09:46:06.131 Perhaps the biggest reason foravocados' rise to dominance
09:46:09.050 is the emergence of theclean-eating lifestyle.
09:46:12.137 No longer just a chip dipfor special occasions,
09:46:14.848 this superfood can be foundin a plethora of recipes
09:46:17.392 in cafés and restaurantseverywhere around the world.
09:46:20.979 And those who are eatingthem are really keen
09:46:22.856 for you to know about it.
09:46:24.566 Just type #avocado intoInstagram, and you'll be hit
09:46:27.861 with over 10 million search results.
09:46:30.822 But is the glorificationof avocado justified?
09:46:33.575 Wallace: There's quite abig hype around avocados,
09:46:35.535 but it actually is quitejustified when it comes
09:46:37.620 to how nutrient-dense this food is.
09:46:40.373 There's not many foodsthat actually replicate it
09:46:43.293 in terms of a nutritional profile.
09:46:45.628 When it comes to callingsomething a superfood,
09:46:47.630 I'm not really for that label.
09:46:49.924 Avocados are definitely a good food
09:46:52.218 to include in your diet, but like I said,
09:46:53.803 you're not really missingout if you don't like them
09:46:56.389 or if you can't eat them for any reason.
09:46:58.349 Monounsaturated fats, wecan find that in things
09:47:00.852 like olive oil and olive, nuts, and seeds.
09:47:03.479 The vitamins andminerals, we can find that
09:47:05.398 in other green vegetables,so spinach and broccoli
09:47:08.568 and things like that.
09:47:09.402 So there's ways ofgetting those nutrients in
09:47:11.362 without having avocado.
09:47:13.740 Narrator: All of this produce requires
09:47:15.116 an astonishing amount of labor.
09:47:17.410 Even once grown, pruned, and picked,
09:47:20.121 avocados need costly distribution methods
09:47:22.665 in order to be delivered fresh and ripe
09:47:24.667 to far-flung corners of the world.
09:47:27.003 Gunderson: If you're livingin Philadelphia, right?
09:47:28.713 You wanna buy a ripeavocado in Philadelphia?
09:47:31.799 What they do is they ship green avocados
09:47:34.302 from California to Philadelphia,
09:47:36.387 they send them to the ripening center,
09:47:38.681 they warm them up andget ethylene in them,
09:47:42.018 so they all ripen, and then,
09:47:43.770 when they're moved outto the retail stores,
09:47:46.981 you're actually buying something
09:47:48.191 that's almost ready toeat or ready to eat.
09:47:51.069 'Cause if you were to buy agreen avocado that's shipped
09:47:53.196 straight from California to your market,
09:47:56.115 you would have to ripen it yourself
09:47:58.159 over a seven- to 10-day period,
09:48:00.995 and most consumers area little more anxious
09:48:03.164 for their avocado toast thanwaiting 10 days. [laughs]
09:48:08.086 Narrator: With prices so high,the commodity of avocados
09:48:11.005 has attracted a spateof thefts from orchards
09:48:13.424 and delivery trucks worldwide.
09:48:15.635 In New Zealand, armed nightpatrols and electric fences
09:48:18.888 have been introduced aftera grower in Northland
09:48:21.307 had 70% of his orchard stolen.
09:48:24.560 There's even further grimreading for avocado lovers.
09:48:28.106 In Michoacán, where 80% ofMexico's avocados originate,
09:48:31.943 cartels run a so-called"blood avocado" trade,
09:48:34.737 violently enforcing anonnegotiable extortion fee
09:48:37.323 from farmers based onthe size of their land
09:48:39.659 and the weight of their crop.
09:48:41.327 Some restaurants havebegun an avocado boycott,
09:48:43.871 as we all weigh the ethicsbehind our eating habits.
09:48:46.833 Experts suggest that water shortages
09:48:48.710 could affect 5 billion people by 2050,
09:48:51.671 and rainfall in theso-called drought belt,
09:48:53.923 which includes Mexico and South America,
09:48:56.092 is predicted to decline.
09:48:58.261 But whilst evidence ofenvironmental degradation
09:49:00.179 is mounting, the avocadoindustry is still growing
09:49:03.057 along with consumer demand.
09:49:05.351 In certain places, thesustainability of avocado production
09:49:08.855 will become untenable.
09:49:12.692 Modern art is expensive.
09:49:16.571 From completely white canvases
09:49:18.406 to simple, abstract colors,
09:49:20.283 these seemingly basic workscan cost you millions.
09:49:24.912 So what makes their price so high,
09:49:27.290 and how can they possiblybe worth this much money?
09:49:42.221 Modern art is a wide field,
09:49:44.599 covering everything fromaround 1870 to 1970.
09:49:49.187 But say "modern art" tosomeone on the street,
09:49:51.689 and chances are they possiblypicture something like this.
09:49:56.736 At the turn of the century, art changed.
09:49:59.739 From the birth of abstract impressionism
09:50:01.699 to the minimalists andeven performance art,
09:50:05.119 art was no longer just about representing
09:50:07.080 the world with skill.
09:50:08.915 Susie Hodge: That skill faded away
09:50:11.250 after photography was invented.
09:50:13.044 Once photography was invented,
09:50:14.712 that was a skill the camera could do,
09:50:16.297 so artists no longer felt that
09:50:18.841 that was their primaryreason for making art.
09:50:21.969 Art isn't about beauty.
09:50:23.262 That's...it never was, really.
09:50:26.724 Narrator: Art generallybecame more conceptual
09:50:29.143 and more challenging.
09:50:30.812 But this change wasn'tpopular with everyone.
09:50:33.689 In a 2016 study of the British public,
09:50:36.984 28% of people don't consider this art.
09:50:40.279 65% of people don't think this is art.
09:50:43.282 And 83% of the public
09:50:45.118 definitely don't consider this to be art.
09:50:47.370 Over 100 years after its creation,
09:50:49.497 the work is still somehow as divisive
09:50:51.874 and controversial as ever with the public,
09:50:54.168 but that hasn't stoppedrecord prices being set.
09:50:57.463 Hodge: I think most people think
09:50:59.173 that modern or contemporary artists
09:51:02.885 are having a laugh at their expense,
09:51:04.637 and nobody wants to feel a fool.
09:51:07.765 Narrator: For many whoare immediately dismissive
09:51:09.434 of these pieces,
09:51:10.560 frustration also often comeswhen they see the price.
09:51:15.148 Ana Maria Celis: Most of us,I think, tend to be cynics,
09:51:17.066 and we, I think, a lot of times
09:51:19.819 associate art with value,
09:51:23.239 and I think that triggersthe question of, well,
09:51:27.285 why is it that much?
09:51:29.454 Or, why such a high value
09:51:32.039 if, you know, I could probably do this?
09:51:34.584 I think, unless you're in the market
09:51:35.918 and actively buying art,
09:51:37.128 there's no need to look at art
09:51:38.421 and think about price tag.
09:51:40.006 It shouldn't be the way you look at art.
09:51:44.886 Narrator: For the artists involved,
09:51:46.304 what looks simple can be the culmination
09:51:48.723 of a lifetime's work.
09:51:50.766 Take the "Black Square," for example,
09:51:53.060 painted by turn-of-the-century
09:51:54.687 avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich.
09:51:58.024 This simple black paintingdidn't come out of nowhere.
09:52:00.860 It's the result of 20 years
09:52:02.403 of simplification and development.
09:52:04.864 When it was shown,
09:52:05.698 the "Black Square" wasa revolutionary symbol,
09:52:08.075 exhibited at the top corner of the room,
09:52:10.286 a spot reserved fororthodox religious icons.
09:52:13.414 Making this work wasn't exactlyan easy decision either,
09:52:16.751 and in 1930, Stalin's regime confiscated
09:52:19.712 Malevich's artworks and manuscripts,
09:52:22.048 and he was jailed for two months.
09:52:24.258 Hodge: Yes, the whitecanvases or the black canvases
09:52:27.178 are very rarely all they've done.
09:52:30.056 They haven't just come out of school
09:52:31.265 and said, "I could paint a black canvas."
09:52:32.808 I mean, as much as we mightthink we could do that,
09:52:35.436 yes, we could do that,
09:52:36.729 but the artist has thought of it
09:52:38.814 and probably had a journey,
09:52:40.566 quite a long journey, anda process to get there.
09:52:45.196 Narrator: The works aren'tjust made for profit.
09:52:47.406 It's often only after the artist is dead
09:52:49.617 that the art can fetchthe incredible price
09:52:51.744 that it's reached today.
09:52:53.538 In 2008, one of Malevich's abstract works
09:52:56.666 sold for $60 million,
09:52:59.335 and the demand for theseimportant modern works
09:53:01.295 is only going to increase.
09:53:03.839 Celis: The natural trend is foryou to see a rise in prices,
09:53:08.761 but that's because it's,
09:53:10.972 these true masterpieces are rare to find
09:53:14.058 because they're really all in museums.
09:53:18.688 Narrator: But setting anactual price can be tough.
09:53:21.232 In the end, the value is only going to be
09:53:23.484 what people are willing to pay.
09:53:26.195 Celis: As long as there'sgoing to be artists producing,
09:53:28.364 there's always going to be sort of shifts
09:53:30.616 in tendencies andtastes, I would say also,
09:53:33.327 in tastes in the market.
09:53:36.038 Narrator: It seems like every year
09:53:37.164 there's a new record price,
09:53:38.791 and as extreme wealthinequality increases,
09:53:41.294 so do the number of millionaires willing
09:53:42.920 to pay the fortunerequired for these works.
09:53:46.299 No matter what the artist intended,
09:53:48.467 art is now seen as aneasy investment by many,
09:53:51.345 and companies have appearedto treat art purely
09:53:53.889 as an asset for financial gain.
09:53:56.267 But despite the ever-increasing prices
09:53:58.227 of the modernist masterpieces,
09:54:00.146 for 99% of the artists out there,
09:54:02.565 their work has alwaysbeen a labor of love.
09:54:05.860 Josef Neet: There areobviously people out there
09:54:06.944 with a lot of money who view art
09:54:08.529 just to be a commodity and nothing else,
09:54:10.948 but there's gonna be people
09:54:13.242 who purchase or engage with it
09:54:15.953 because they take genuine pleasure from it
09:54:18.539 or it stimulates them orthey feel it enriches them.
09:54:22.877 I'm an abstract painter.
09:54:25.504 Not really dealing much with form.
09:54:27.381 I became quite obsessed;
09:54:28.466 I was painting all day and all night,
09:54:30.760 and it was just something that really,
09:54:33.596 that kind of took ahold of me, so.
09:54:37.391 It's not easy being an artist in London.
09:54:41.562 There's a lot of reallygood talent out there.
09:54:43.522 I think you've really gotta be good
09:54:45.024 to actually make any money.
09:54:47.193 You don't have the, Isuppose, network, initially.
09:54:51.739 Yeah, it's a really expensive habit,
09:54:53.908 to be honest.
09:54:55.576 I suppose that everybody'sgot their vices,
09:54:57.244 but it's my kind of passion and hobby,
09:55:00.164 so that's where all my time, effort,
09:55:03.125 and kind of spare finances go.
09:55:08.589 Narrator: Trends in the market may change,
09:55:10.800 and prices will shift,
09:55:12.677 but the popularity of modern
09:55:14.387 and contemporary art isn't going anywhere.
