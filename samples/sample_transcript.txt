00:50:09.520 truly wild sheep don't need shearing as
00:50:12.359 they naturally shed their winter coat

00:50:17.480 right a few domesticated breeds also do
00:50:23.160 this but most need to be Shor
00:50:32.119 the ory sheep have a soft underlayer to

00:53:20.160 Birds first on the scene are hooded
00:53:23.480 crows
00:53:27.440 these highly sociable birds have over 20

00:53:45.480 within the murder as a group of crows is
00:53:51.760 known but that's not the only pecking
00:53:54.280 order that must be respected
00:53:57.799 the feast has caught the attention of

00:54:04.720 Ravens these are the biggest birds in

00:56:17.599 miles an excellent Hunter the eagle is
00:56:21.200 also an

00:56:25.240 chance to pass out
00:56:32.280 up golden eagles take several years to
00:56:35.240 reach maturity and the distinct White

00:57:01.200 their main threat comes from human

00:57:10.480 these rugged Islands have one of the

00:59:48.480 all they need to know and providing
00:59:50.720 every meal they eat
00:59:57.319 their Island contains one of the highest
00:59:59.559 densities of utter in Europe and there's
01:00:02.319 a simple reason
01:00:06.559 why the Shetland Islands lie over a 100
01:00:10.000 miles north of the
01:00:12.920 Mainland far out in the North Atlantic
01:00:16.160 they should be surrounded by freezing
01:00:18.520 water but due to a current funneling up
01:00:21.480 from as far south as
01:00:24.799 Spain the the animals Frolic in
01:00:27.319 surprisingly warm nutrient-rich water
01:00:31.400 it's comfortable for swimming and
01:00:33.319 supports a wealth of marine
01:00:36.720 life no wonder that the shetland's otter
01:00:39.640 do so
01:00:46.359 well it just goes to show how each of
01:00:49.240 our 6,000 Islands can be
01:00:54.000 different each is a very particular kind
01:00:56.799 of Oasis providing just what certain
01:00:59.760 animals need to
01:01:02.720 flourish otter may be a rare site on
01:01:05.520 Mainland Britain but on Shetland in

01:02:12.880 spots this female Arctic turn has just
01:02:17.760 arrived now she's waiting for her
01:02:20.200 partner to show
01:02:24.279 up each turn has a unique call that it
01:02:27.880 uses when returning to its colony to

01:03:42.640 the aisle of
01:03:44.400 May 6 weeks
01:03:50.079 later these ocean Wanderers mate for
01:03:53.279 life but don't travel together
01:03:58.160 so it takes a while for a couple to be
01:04:00.160 reunited on this extremely busy

01:04:35.559 over her mate may have spent three
01:04:38.160 months winging his way around the globe
01:04:41.160 but this is the breeding season and he's
01:04:43.599 Keen to get on with
01:04:48.680 it the female will start laying in just
01:04:51.599 10 days
01:04:53.559 time so the pair had better find a
01:05:01.039 home luckily turns aren't
01:05:05.359 picky they make do with a scrape in the
01:05:10.850 [Music]
01:05:13.920 dirt as is the case on many islands
01:05:16.319 there's no need for an actual Nest as
01:05:18.880 there are no ground Predators around to
01:05:20.839 steal their eggs
01:05:26.880 it'll be a 3 week wait until the eggs
01:05:29.400 hatch until then Mom and Dad just have
01:05:32.920 to sit
01:05:41.039 tight of course it's not just birds that
01:05:44.480 visit our
01:05:49.000 Islands there's a much loved mammal
01:05:51.799 that's also drawn to their Shores
01:05:56.900 [Music]
01:06:04.160 over 80% of Europe's gray seals are
01:06:07.359 found around our
01:06:11.400 Islands they're the biggest animal
01:06:13.520 breeding on Britain's Shores and may
01:06:16.079 well be the most
01:06:21.279 curious one of the largest groups is
01:06:23.880 around the far Islands off the coast of

01:06:36.920 round Jane Hardy is a wild swimmer with
01:06:40.760 an immense passion for these charismatic
01:06:44.000 animals the waters here are fantastic
01:06:46.680 for seals because they've got no
01:06:49.680 predators in other parts of the world
01:06:52.039 the Sharks killer
01:06:54.240 whales the temperature is perfect for
01:06:56.559 them they've got a nice layer of blubber
01:06:58.160 they don't mind the
01:07:01.480 cold feeding on a wide variety of fish
01:07:04.920 squid and
01:07:06.880 octopus gry seals spend 80% of their
01:07:10.279 time below
01:07:12.480 water often staying down for 30 minutes
01:07:15.480 at a
01:07:18.359 time the seals on the far islands are
01:07:21.599 particularly unique because there's so
01:07:23.839 many shipwrecks off the far Islands
01:07:26.000 boats go out regularly with
01:07:28.559 divers so the seals are sort of used to
01:07:31.799 humans being around them watching them
01:07:33.720 and appreciating
01:07:37.599 them if this seal looks a little
01:07:40.119 familiar it could be because it's
01:07:42.319 distantly related to your family
01:07:45.319 pet a few million years ago seals shared
01:07:49.559 a common ancestor with dogs
01:07:56.240 it's absolutely wonderful to see the
01:07:58.200 seals in the natural
01:08:06.079 environment there's a tiny tiny amount
01:08:08.839 of
01:08:10.119 fear but they're not threatening either
01:08:12.799 because they're just going about their
01:08:17.880 business with females up to 1 and 1/2 M
01:08:21.158 long and weighing 150 kilos and males
01:08:24.600 almost twice that they inspire a healthy

01:08:36.080 respect wild swimming gives Jane a
01:08:39.040 privileged view of these curious
01:08:44.640 creatures and as a nation we're equally
01:08:47.560 lucky to have so many Island habitats
01:08:50.158 dotted around our

01:13:43.840 protected there are currently thought to
01:13:45.880 be around 200 red squirrels hiding out
01:13:48.560 in this island retreat
01:13:55.800 come Autumn they do What squirrels do
01:14:00.960 best they gather
01:14:04.800 food they eat all kinds of seeds berries
01:14:08.480 fungi and
01:14:13.280 nuts at this time of year they come down
01:14:16.320 to the ground to get as fat as they
01:14:19.320 can if this little guy really stuffs his
01:14:22.080 face he can increase his weight by 12%
01:14:24.480 in just a few
01:14:28.920 weeks giving him an excellent chance of
01:14:31.719 surviving the

01:15:16.880 Brown SE
01:15:18.400 squirrels is that they're
01:15:21.040 unique although the reintroduction of
01:15:23.400 red squirrels in parts of Main and
01:15:25.199 Britain has bumped up the
01:15:27.400 numbers the animals used were from
01:15:33.760 Scandinavia which means this little Band
01:15:36.199 of Brothers may be the last truly native
01:15:40.040 red squirrels we
01:15:47.960 have for our Arctic turns on the aisle

01:19:40.199 can throw at
01:19:45.480 them the goats just have to tough it out
01:19:49.360 and they can do it thanks to their
01:19:52.760 coats a cashmir under coat keeps warm
01:19:55.760 air next to their bodies while their
01:19:58.080 outer hairs protect them from the

01:20:04.560 the tribes come down from the hills to

01:25:26.930 [Music]
01:25:31.639 birds Professor Tim Guilford from the
01:25:34.119 University of Oxford has spent his life
01:25:36.679 exploring islands like this and
01:25:39.480 observing the wildlife that lives in
01:25:41.800 these special
01:25:45.400 places Tim has been visiting SCA for
01:25:48.119 decades studying its many
01:25:51.080 seabirds but there's one seabird that
01:25:53.639 despite its vast numbers remains more
01:25:56.320 mysterious than any
01:25:58.080 other the mans sheer
01:26:04.040 waterer scha together with its sister
01:26:06.960 Island Skookum houses more than half the
01:26:10.080 world's population of man Shear Waters
01:26:12.960 making this their most important
01:26:14.440 breeding Colony on
01:26:17.110 [Music]
01:26:22.040 Earth the breeding season begins in
01:26:24.760 March when the birds arrive to nest in
01:26:27.840 Burrows using the same one each year and
01:26:31.800 for the most part staying with the same
01:26:38.199 partner wary of predatory gulls that
01:26:40.960 Patrol by day they wait until Nightfall
01:26:44.600 to return to their nests
01:26:57.239 this and the fact that they spend most
01:26:59.119 of their time far out to seea makes it
01:27:01.760 extremely tricky to study
01:27:05.960 them but Tim has found a way using
01:27:09.679 miniature tracking technology to spy on
01:27:12.400 their daily
01:27:17.159 routines putting trackers on the birds
01:27:19.760 and plotting the data they gather has
01:27:21.920 allowed Tim to gain huge insight into
01:27:24.400 the bird's mysterious
01:27:29.159 lives each colored track shows a
01:27:32.080 different sheer Waters Journey as it
01:27:34.119 heads out to
01:27:35.520 sea strangely some of them appear to be
01:27:38.600 away for a week or even two weeks at a
01:27:42.159 time at first Tim thought these might be
01:27:44.920 parents giving up on their
01:27:47.560 chicks but far from abandoning their
01:27:50.159 young it turns out that the sheer waters
01:27:53.280 are employing a clever parenting
01:27:57.920 technique while one parent makes short
01:28:00.400 trips to collect fish for the chicks the
01:28:03.320 other is traveling further a field to
01:28:05.920 find larger meals for
01:28:11.800 itself it's a unique strategy and it's
01:28:15.080 clearly
01:28:17.239 successful not only do 90% of man Shear
01:28:20.159 water chicks fledge and leave the island
01:28:22.199 each
01:28:23.119 season but the adult birds are very long
01:28:26.159 lived known to survive for 50 years or
01:28:32.360 more their life away from Scoma remains
01:28:35.960 largely
01:28:37.159 unknown but at least one mystery has

01:52:38.520 everyone our British Countryside has
01:52:41.199 changed more in the last 100 years than
01:52:44.079 in the previous
01:52:45.679 2,000 the sheer speed of change puts a

01:53:53.119 from Italy a 100 Years Ago by wealthy

01:53:59.320 adapted well and quickly
01:54:03.679 spread their compact size means they can
01:54:06.599 use small tree Hollows to raise a
01:54:09.920 family but life in a little owl Nest is
01:54:12.840 far from cute and cozy it can be
01:54:16.360 brutal because little ow chicks have a
01:54:19.920 dark side
01:54:22.880 mom lays up to four eggs that hatch a
01:54:25.560 month
01:54:29.880 later both parents work in shifts to
01:54:32.880 bring a constant supply of worms insects
01:54:35.599 and small
01:54:41.639 rodents the chicks ruthlessly compete

01:54:53.119 when one chick starts to fall behind he
01:54:56.000 quickly

01:55:00.320 chance but the fight's not finished
01:55:04.880 yet despite the parents best efforts
01:55:08.159 often only one or two chicks make it

01:58:22.320 they never graze the same patch of grass
01:58:24.360 for more than a day a

02:04:07.079 unique habitats that would never have
02:04:08.960 existed if we hadn't farmed
02:04:11.119 them one of the most precious of all is
02:04:14.079 our lent heaths scattered across
02:04:16.599 England's mild South they hardly look
02:04:19.760 like they've been farmed but they have

02:06:21.639 she's a Potter one of the rarest and
02:06:24.559 most unusual of Britain's 9,000 species

02:06:39.440 indeed now like every good Potter she
02:06:42.360 needs good
02:06:45.679 clay she softens it with water collected
02:06:49.079 from local pools and expertly rolls a

02:07:48.280 shape she begins to Fashion a bowl which
02:07:51.960 gradually becomes
02:07:59.159 spherical it takes several hours and
02:08:01.520 more than 20 trips before her Exquisite
02:08:04.440 pot is
02:08:09.599 complete she leaves it to fire in the
02:08:12.800 sun soon her nest will be ready
02:08:23.360 she returns to lay a single egg in her
02:08:26.119 pot suspended on a strand of
02:08:29.800 silk but her hard work has only just
02:08:34.960 begun her egg needs a Luder of food
02:08:38.079 ready for when it hatches so she's on
02:08:40.760 the
02:08:41.210 [Music]
02:08:43.360 hunt she brings back caterpillars
02:08:46.239 Paralyzed by her sting
02:08:55.880 she starts with seven small brown ones
02:08:59.119 but that's not
02:09:02.199 enough they get
02:09:04.199 bigger and
02:09:08.280 bigger she wants to make sure her lava
02:09:11.119 has plenty of food when it
02:09:13.119 hatches and up to 38 caterpillars can be
02:09:16.400 stuffed into one tiny pot
02:09:24.920 to squeeze them in takes every ounce of

02:09:44.239 effort finally she seals her pot her
02:09:47.639 parental duties over for this egg
02:09:53.199 time for a well-earned
02:09:54.559 rest no
02:09:58.199 chance it's straight on to the next
02:10:01.440 pot she may build a staggering 25 more
02:10:05.760 in her short 3mon
02:10:11.159 life it may seem a lot of effort but the
02:10:14.079 young wasp needs good
02:10:18.639 protection because our heathlands are
02:10:21.440 the realm of exotic
02:10:25.119 Predators
02:10:28.040 reptiles we have three Snake species
02:10:30.760 including the rare smooth
02:10:33.520 snake and we have lizards too like the
02:10:36.719 beautiful endangered sand
02:10:42.760 lizard they're incredibly hard to spot
02:10:46.520 unless you know the tricks of the trade
02:10:51.440 keep my hands behind my back in what
02:10:54.000 what I call my Prince Charles walk
02:10:56.000 because I actually hold one hand to stop
02:10:58.480 myself from going look at that cuz when
02:11:00.719 you move your hand and point you freak
02:11:03.159 out the lizards and they're not there
02:11:04.440 anymore
02:11:08.679 so Peter Hill's been dubbed the lizard
02:11:12.520 wizard his skills have been refined
02:11:15.280 thanks to years of working to protect
02:11:17.559 these rare reptiles
02:11:25.159 sand lizards bask in the early morning
02:11:27.480 sun to raise their body
02:11:30.559 temperature this undulating heathland
02:11:33.199 produces lots of little south-facing Sun
02:11:35.719 traps for
02:11:39.480 them the females are brown but in Spring
02:11:43.320 during breeding season the males sport a
02:11:46.400 bright cloak of color to attract a
02:11:49.320 mate it's pretty intense period of
02:11:52.360 activity for
02:11:54.000 wildlife and to add to that looking at a
02:11:57.639 fantastic little dragon that most people
02:12:00.719 don't even know exist it's just a superb
02:12:07.559 experience numbers have dropped due to
02:12:10.199 loss and breakup of our
02:12:12.800 heaths and Peter's part of a huge effort
02:12:15.559 to return these Exquisite lizards to
02:12:17.800 sites across four Southern counties
02:12:22.639 sand lizards have a unique back pattern
02:12:25.559 which is like a
02:12:27.280 fingerprint recording these means Peter
02:12:29.960 can track
02:12:35.820 [Music]
02:12:45.159 individuals if you're a sand lizard
02:12:47.960 pretty much everything wants to eat you
02:12:51.360 so camouflage is
02:12:53.159 vital the lizard's skin patterns are
02:12:55.840 broken up allowing them to blend in
02:12:58.280 perfectly with their
02:13:00.320 surroundings but Peter has an uncanny
02:13:03.079 knack for finding
02:13:05.760 them most people don't notice them
02:13:07.960 because they tend to be looking up and
02:13:09.280 around at Birds Etc but you need to look
02:13:12.000 down on these edges these little soft
02:13:14.440 pillows of moss they're at the base of
02:13:16.800 the Heather

02:13:23.000 make sure you're not casting a shadow in
02:13:24.719 front of you which will spook
02:13:29.880 them there's a male s

02:15:02.800 jungles and there's a land of
02:15:04.840 opportunity for those who dare to

02:15:34.599 surprising number of wild
02:15:37.920 Pioneers over 13,000 species and

02:16:51.679 than half a kilo if he's to survive the

02:17:07.080 night but finding them in a single
02:17:09.558 Garden is a tall order he must search
02:17:12.638 the entire
02:17:15.959 neighborhood traveling up to 2 miles a
02:17:18.519 night to satisfy his appetite
02:17:22.558 it's no easy feet when your legs are
02:17:25.280 just 4 cm

02:19:08.638 farming is destroying their food and
02:19:14.160 shelter and in our cities more and more
02:19:17.318 man-made barriers are getting in their
02:19:19.398 way
02:19:22.398 Hedges with plenty of holes have been

02:19:28.679 off Food Supplies and even the chance to
02:19:30.760 meet a

02:31:46.200 shy her Cubs will learn to be cautious
02:31:49.080 too
02:31:55.399 a useful trait when foxes aren't

02:52:57.479 not entirely
02:52:59.960 clear perhaps it's for safety or extra
02:53:05.520 warmth or even to meet
