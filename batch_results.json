The transcript mentions \"that the first Ruby Roman grapes went up for sale\" [01:49:13].  While the transcript does not explicitly state *why* they are a luxury, the description of the effort to \"develop a new breed of large red grape\" [01:49:25] suggests a deliberate and potentially resource-intensive process, which could contribute to their luxury status.\n\n**Comparison to Nonthaburi Durian:**\n\nThe transcript excerpts provided **do not contain any information** about Nonthaburi durian. Therefore, based *only* on the given transcript, we cannot determine if or how the cultivation of Ruby Roman grapes mirrors that of Nonthaburi durian.",
