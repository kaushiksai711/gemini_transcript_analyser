00:00:13.759 this is Natans a nuclear facility
00:00:16.720 approximately 200 m from Tran and its
00:00:19.920 goal is to develop Iran's first nuclear
00:00:22.800 bomb
00:00:24.240 it's been built in the middle of a
00:00:25.600 desert under a thick layer of concrete
00:00:28.320 guarded by an entire army and completely
00:00:30.960 cut off from the rest of the world and
00:00:34.079 Iran's efforts to get itself the bomb
00:00:36.399 don't sit well with the United States
00:00:38.480 Israel and a bunch of other countries in
00:00:40.640 the region faced with this threat some
00:00:43.440 countries start a collective effort to
00:00:45.600 find strategies and measures that could
00:00:47.600 thwart Iran's ambitions of course
00:00:51.360 sanctions will affect us but it only
00:00:54.160 will delay our projects after diplomatic
00:00:57.520 efforts fail the allies zero in on
00:01:00.239 another strategy they create stuckset
00:01:03.280 the most powerful cyber weapon in the
00:01:05.600 world stuckset infected and damaged the
00:01:08.560 Iranian nuclear program stuckset is the
00:01:11.520 first time where we've seen significant
00:01:14.479 physical damage created by a cyber
00:01:17.680 attack natans is cut off from the
00:01:20.320 internet the only way to get any malware
00:01:23.600 inside the complex is to find a person
00:01:26.000 who would physically go into the
00:01:28.000 facility and install it on a computer
00:01:30.920 system that person is a Dutch spy who
00:01:33.840 delivered the malware to Natans and
00:01:35.840 enabled the whole
00:01:37.400 operation here is the story of Eric Ben
00:01:40.159 Sabin the spy behind Stuckset
00:01:50.799 there were several reasons for the US to
00:01:53.119 be wary of Iran developing weapons of
00:01:55.360 mass destruction for one if Iran got its
00:01:58.320 hands on nukes all of its neighbors
00:02:00.240 would do whatever they can to get them
00:02:02.079 too the most volatile region on Earth
00:02:04.880 turned to nuclear another reason was
00:02:07.439 pressure from Israel an important ally
00:02:09.440 of the US and a sworn enemy of Iran to
00:02:12.239 whom a nuclear armed adversary would
00:02:14.239 mean an existential
00:02:17.959 threat our second goal is to prevent
00:02:20.560 regimes that sponsor terror from
00:02:23.280 threatening America or our friends and
00:02:25.720 allies with weapons of mass destruction
00:02:29.760 but Iran perceived things differently
00:02:32.640 constantly in conflict with most of its
00:02:34.640 neighbors it saw acquiring the bomb as
00:02:36.959 the only way to ensure its own security
00:02:39.760 but you can't build a bomb without some
00:02:41.760 serious investments you need scientists
00:02:44.440 facilities equipment and most
00:02:46.720 importantly a massive amount of nuclear
00:02:49.560 fuel quite a few countries managed to
00:02:52.080 get all of that though such as Pakistan
00:02:54.160 who tested a nuke in
00:02:55.879 1998 and it gladly sold some of its
00:02:58.400 knowhow to Iran with this head start
00:03:01.760 Iran took batters into its own hands and
00:03:04.159 began setting up the production of
00:03:05.599 nuclear fuel tens of thousands of
00:03:08.560 centrifuges were set up in the tons and
00:03:10.959 configured to produce weaponsgrade
00:03:13.080 uranium initially the allies tried
00:03:15.599 convincing Iran to stop the program but
00:03:18.159 by 2007 the only remaining option was to
00:03:21.200 straight up fly in with bombers and
00:03:22.959 level the tons which is what President
00:03:25.360 George Bush seriously considered and
00:03:27.840 rejected
00:03:29.440 by seeking weapons of mass
00:03:31.400 destruction these regimes pose a grave
00:03:34.480 and growing danger
00:03:37.280 such an attack would mean the start of
00:03:38.959 another all-out war in the Middle East
00:03:40.879 and possibly beyond but there was
00:03:43.680 another option for a few years the NSA
00:03:46.640 was exploring the scenario of disabling
00:03:48.640 the tons with a malicious program the
00:03:51.519 man in charge of that research was Keith
00:03:53.360 Alexander the first director of the NSA
00:03:55.840 with a background in computer science
00:03:57.519 and a knack for grandiose
00:03:59.720 operations under his leadership the
00:04:02.159 agency kept collecting every bit of
00:04:04.080 intel about the Iranian nuclear program
00:04:06.560 they even seized some Pakistani
00:04:08.239 equipment sold to Libya and built a
00:04:10.159 replica of Natans to test the attack
00:04:13.280 alexander's project was approved by
00:04:15.040 George Bush in 2008 and called Operation
00:04:18.320 Olympic Games and its result was nothing
00:04:21.680 but groundbreaking according to numerous
00:04:24.320 researchers it was a cyber equivalent of
00:04:26.479 the moonlanding project revolutionary
00:04:29.360 stupendously expensive and something we
00:04:32.160 haven't seen ever since it cost up to $2
00:04:35.280 billion and took several years to
00:04:37.440 develop it also used four unique
00:04:40.400 vulnerabilities in Windows code even one
00:04:43.600 of those is extremely rare to find and
00:04:45.680 could cost millions on the underground
00:04:47.560 market and here's how it worked the
00:04:50.639 malware would infiltrate Natans stay
00:04:53.479 hidden and destroy the
00:04:55.960 centrifuges by slowly very slowly
00:04:59.280 spinning some of them out of control
00:05:02.560 in the span of several months the rate
00:05:04.560 of critical failure would slightly
00:05:06.320 increase not enough to raise suspicion
00:05:09.039 but enough to throw a serious wrench
00:05:10.960 into Iran's nuclear efforts it was a
00:05:14.000 genius solution to a difficult problem
00:05:16.560 but it had one fatal flaw how to deliver
00:05:20.000 a piece of malware to one of the most
00:05:22.240 secure places on the
00:05:24.440 planet by the way if you like this video

00:05:29.120 miss our next one thanks
00:05:34.320 it was the air gap the most basic and
00:05:37.520 the most effective form of network
00:05:39.199 security it's when you literally cut off
00:05:41.440 your computers from all external
00:05:43.280 connections so there's no physical
00:05:45.039 connection between them and the internet
00:05:47.120 at large natans had an expansive and
00:05:50.240 complex internal computer system but
00:05:52.400 that system was separated from the rest
00:05:54.240 of the world by miles and miles of
00:05:56.720 desert to deliver malware into the
00:05:59.600 facility you had to get there physically
00:06:01.919 and if you had seen at least one spy
00:06:03.759 movie you know this is where handsome
00:06:06.160 smartly dressed people with a particular
00:06:08.160 set of skills come in the NSA needed a
00:06:11.440 secret agent who could breach Natans but
00:06:14.560 it didn't have one well sure the NSA had
00:06:17.759 lots of special agents but not the ones
00:06:20.240 that can walt in and out of a secret
00:06:22.080 military facility in the middle of an
00:06:24.160 adversar's territory
00:06:26.319 so the agency shopped around for
00:06:28.720 possibilities and eventually found one
00:06:32.120 AIVD the Dutch General Intelligence and
00:06:35.039 Security Service basically an equivalent
00:06:37.840 of the CIA from the Netherlands being a
00:06:40.639 close ally of the United States it
00:06:42.560 agreed to help sabotage Iran's nuclear
00:06:44.639 program it also had the perfect man to
00:06:47.360 do that Eric Vansabin a 36-year-old
00:06:50.880 engineer with an Iranian wife crucially
00:06:54.080 Eric worked for a Dubai based company
00:06:56.240 that regularly smuggled sanctioned
00:06:58.240 equipment to Iran he was recruited by
00:07:01.360 the AIVD in 2005 becoming a mole for law
00:07:04.639 enforcement in a company that regularly
00:07:07.039 breaks the law and in 2008 he got a
00:07:10.000 special assignment he had to pay a
00:07:11.919 10-day visit to Iran ostensibly to visit
00:07:14.639 his wife's relatives and celebrate the
00:07:16.639 new
00:07:17.800 year during that visit something strange
00:07:20.880 happened suddenly Eric became nervous
00:07:23.599 and scared to the point of panic he got
00:07:26.000 out of Iran as quickly as possible as if
00:07:28.400 somebody was chasing him in retrospect
00:07:31.360 it was quite unusual for a man who had
00:07:33.280 worked for a company that did lots of
00:07:35.039 illegal stuff and even more so
00:07:37.280 considering that he spent years working
00:07:39.479 undercover something during that visit
00:07:41.680 scared him something he saw or
00:07:44.280 experienced or did in Iran we may never
00:07:48.240 know for sure but some sources indicate
00:07:50.639 that visiting relatives was just a cover
00:07:52.880 story in reality Eric came to Iran to
00:07:56.160 smuggle water pumps sophisticated
00:07:58.400 equipment sanctioned by the United
00:08:00.080 Nations and nearly impossible to acquire
00:08:02.639 for
00:08:03.400 Iran those water pumps were installed in
00:08:06.160 Natans and one of them had a nasty
00:08:08.639 surprise a copy of Stuckset left there
00:08:11.759 by the NSA according to Dutch special
00:08:14.960 services the Americans didn't even
00:08:17.039 notify AIVD about this mission they just
00:08:20.160 used their spy to gain access to Iran's
00:08:22.400 nuclear facility which eventually led to
00:08:24.800 a bit of a diplomatic clash between the
00:08:26.960 US and the Netherlands as for Eric
00:08:29.759 himself his nervousness and a hasty
00:08:32.080 flight from Iran shows that he most
00:08:34.080 likely knew what happened or at least
00:08:36.240 suspected something whatever the case he
00:08:39.279 didn't have much time left several weeks
00:08:42.159 later in January 2009 Eric was riding
00:08:45.200 his motorcycle through Shaha near Dubai
00:08:48.080 suddenly he lost control of the machine
00:08:50.000 and fell in a matter of seconds his neck
00:08:52.880 was broken and the Dutch secret agent
00:08:55.360 was no
00:08:59.880 more for over a decade nobody knew how
00:09:03.360 Stucksnut got into Natans many theorized
00:09:06.720 it was one of the workers at the
00:09:08.160 facility who willingly or unwillingly
00:09:10.720 snuck it in on a USB stick in 2019 an
00:09:14.800 investigation by several journalists
00:09:16.720 revealed that Dutch intelligence
00:09:18.160 services were involved but what exactly
00:09:20.560 this meant remained a mystery only in
00:09:23.760 2024 after an extensive search for
00:09:26.160 witnesses a Dutch newspaper Vulkront
00:09:28.880 finally revealed the truth numerous
00:09:31.279 officials from the Netherlands Israel
00:09:33.200 and the United States confirmed the role
00:09:35.360 of Vansabin and his water pumps this
00:09:38.959 doesn't mean we have to dismiss that
00:09:40.560 previous story about Stuckset being
00:09:42.640 delivered on a USB stick there were
00:09:45.040 three versions of the malware each more
00:09:47.120 destructive than the last the
00:09:49.120 development project was passed to the
00:09:50.720 Obama administration which renewed it
00:09:52.720 with vigor the initial plan was deemed
00:09:55.279 too slow the new versions of the worm
00:09:57.600 were designed to work faster and more
00:10:00.040 aggressively vansabin delivered just one
00:10:02.800 stuckset version out of the three two
00:10:05.519 more got into Natans some other way
00:10:08.160 maybe through other agents smugglers or
00:10:10.720 USB stick wielding scientists we may
00:10:13.600 never know the people behind those
00:10:16.240 attacks may be alive and well or caught
00:10:19.200 by Iran
00:10:23.000 or when Dutch journalists talked to
00:10:25.519 people close to Vansabin both his
00:10:27.680 relatives and the first responders who
00:10:29.680 got to the scene after his motorcycle
00:10:31.360 accident all of them agreed there is no
00:10:34.160 indication that the agent's death was
00:10:36.240 anything but an accident no signs of
00:10:38.640 attack no traces of tampering on the
00:10:40.839 motorcycle nothing but then one
00:10:44.720 anonymous AIVD employee did not agree
00:10:48.160 with that he paid a high price the
00:10:51.839 employee said was Eric really killed for
00:10:55.120 what he did and if so who accomplished
00:10:57.920 that was it Iran's retaliation or
00:11:00.880 somebody tried to tie up loose ends the
00:11:03.920 existence of stuckset was revealed only
00:11:06.000 in 2010 when the third version of the
00:11:08.079 malware began spreading through the
00:11:10.120 world researchers combed through the
00:11:12.560 code and eventually found out what it
00:11:14.640 did by then Iran developed an antidote
00:11:17.360 to the worm and the work at Natans
00:11:19.880 resumed according to various estimates
00:11:22.720 Stuckset destroyed around a thousand
00:11:24.600 centrifuges and held up the nuclear
00:11:26.800 program for a year or two experts agree
00:11:29.360 that its efforts on the target were
00:11:30.959 mixed at best or at least not
00:11:33.120 particularly reflective of its estimated
00:11:35.640 cost but this wasn't the largest impact
00:11:38.320 of Stuckset many call it the first true
00:11:41.120 cyber weapon or at least the first one
00:11:43.360 that caused destruction in the real
00:11:45.320 world it started the age of cyber
00:11:48.160 warfare and that start was marked by the
00:11:50.800 work of one person named Eric
00:12:03.519 december
00:12:04.600 2012 Kyle Wilhoy a seasoned cyber
00:12:07.680 security researcher creates an
00:12:10.200 experiment he builds a water plant a
00:12:13.519 network of advanced industrial control
00:12:15.360 systems with complicated equipment full
00:12:17.920 documentation and a website to boot
00:12:21.200 according to the legend the plant is
00:12:23.120 located in the town of Arnold Missouri
00:12:26.079 but in reality it's completely virtual
00:12:28.720 it runs from a couple of machines in
00:12:30.240 Kyle's basement sending fake
00:12:31.839 measurements back and forth to imitate
00:12:33.720 activity the researcher takes a deep
00:12:36.000 breath and connects the system to the
00:12:38.120 internet the experiment begins within
00:12:41.600 several days interesting things start
00:12:43.839 happening the plant gets attacked from
00:12:45.920 all sides north Korean military hackers
00:12:48.800 Russian ransomware gangs even trolls
00:12:51.040 from across the US and Europe they
00:12:53.360 attempt to do all kinds of mischief for
00:12:55.200 fun and profit connecting to the servers
00:12:57.920 breaking login pages and injecting code
00:13:00.320 wherever
00:13:01.480 possible but among all of them one
00:13:04.399 attack stands out several fishing emails
00:13:07.279 drop into the box of the supposed plant
00:13:09.839 they're well researched and written with
00:13:11.920 legitimate looking attachments one text
00:13:14.560 document hides malware when launched the
00:13:17.760 malware scrapes the virtual plant it
00:13:20.240 finds the equipment documentation and
00:13:22.160 beams that straight to a command and
00:13:23.839 control server kyle follows surprised at
00:13:27.040 the lack of effort it takes to track the
00:13:28.920 attacker the server's in China it's big
00:13:33.120 and it's full governmental records
00:13:36.480 documents and corporate secrets kyle
00:13:39.440 can't believe his eyes he got them he
00:13:43.040 found
00:13:44.040 AP1 the hacker group that conducted
00:13:46.880 Operation Shady Rat
00:13:54.700 [Music]
00:13:56.720 at that point similar stories almost
00:13:58.880 beat by beat have been happening
00:14:00.480 worldwide for 6 years except that their
00:14:03.120 victims weren't virtual it all began in
00:14:06.519 2006 when an employee of a construction
00:14:09.120 company in South Korea received an email
00:14:11.199 with an
00:14:12.120 attachment it was sent from an address
00:14:14.480 bearing the name of his colleague but
00:14:16.399 there was something weird about it
00:14:18.560 confused the worker replied to double
00:14:20.560 check and within several minutes he got
00:14:23.040 a confirmation the file is
00:14:26.040 legit however the attachment didn't open
00:14:29.920 instead it started a malicious code a
00:14:32.720 remote access Trojan was launched on the
00:14:35.040 worker's computer a
00:14:37.720 rat in just several months at least
00:14:40.560 eight companies were attacked by the
00:14:42.240 same rat and dozens more by similar ones
00:14:45.760 all of these intrusions had the same
00:14:47.440 pattern a spear fishing email posing as
00:14:50.560 one from a close acquaintance it
00:14:52.720 displayed some knowledge of the company
00:14:54.720 but was written in pretty poor English
00:14:56.720 as if they were in a hurry the
00:14:58.480 attachment would hide a rat masked as a
00:15:00.639 document or some other file the
00:15:02.639 attackers would converse with the victim
00:15:04.399 and spare no effort to talk their way
00:15:06.240 through their defenses this is in the
00:15:08.240 era of you know we're not worried about
00:15:10.160 attribution and so it it's it's largely
00:15:13.199 companies and organizations that had by
00:15:16.000 by today's standards laughable cyber
00:15:18.160 security i I remember seeing uh you know
00:15:20.399 some shady rad intrusions where they
00:15:22.480 were emailing screen savers as an
00:15:24.639 attachment right um and and you look
00:15:26.959 today and you're like I'm sorry you you
00:15:29.920 let a screen saver through the email
00:15:31.760 gateway right um let alone that the user
00:15:34.480 is like oh a screen saver cool i'll just
00:15:36.800 download this and run it on my machine
00:15:39.440 the methods were crude yet effective but
00:15:42.320 the most important element wasn't the
00:15:44.079 breach itself it was what happened later
00:15:46.959 the attackers didn't run away they
00:15:49.040 loitered keeping tabs on the system
00:15:51.279 siphoning all the new data that appeared
00:15:53.120 there at the same time they would start
00:15:55.440 moving laterally using the gains
00:15:57.839 knowledge and access they would infect
00:15:59.759 adjacent systems other computers in the
00:16:02.399 network other branches of the company
00:16:05.120 they would repeat the same pattern again
00:16:07.360 and again building a rat cave under the
00:16:09.920 noses of their victims the shortest
00:16:12.240 documented intrusion of such kind lasted
00:16:14.560 for around 1 month the longest one for
00:16:17.600 almost 5 years their goal isn't to
00:16:21.040 disrupt as much as it's to sit and
00:16:23.519 collect and learn and send data back to
00:16:26.399 the central locations so they need to
00:16:28.560 adapt it's it's a lot harder to stay
00:16:30.880 inside of a network without being
00:16:32.399 detected and still be able to observe
00:16:34.480 and be active than it is to um go in
00:16:37.440 smash grab and and run off such attacks
00:16:41.440 were slowly becoming endemic scrambling
00:16:44.079 for answers the US government started
00:16:46.399 attracting private cyber security
00:16:48.160 companies and sharing information with
00:16:50.079 them hoping to shed some light on the
00:16:51.839 situation a new name was coined denoting
00:16:54.880 a hacker group capable of executing such
00:16:57.120 a long-asting attack AP or advanced
00:17:01.040 persistent threat however it wasn't
00:17:03.920 until several years later that it became
00:17:06.160 clear who the original AP
00:17:09.000 was the credit for the first
00:17:10.959 counterattack against the rat goes to a
00:17:13.280 treat research team at McAfee in 2011
00:17:16.319 they broke into the server where the
00:17:17.839 stolen documents were stored it housed
00:17:20.000 the logs documenting the rat's victims
00:17:22.880 governments institutions companies and
00:17:25.760 other organizations all the victims were
00:17:28.240 breached by the same method and all of
00:17:30.400 their documents were siphoned through
00:17:31.840 the same rat caves things clicked into
00:17:34.320 place all the AP activity which seemed
00:17:37.440 like a bunch of disjointed attacks were
00:17:39.760 planned and centrally coordinated it was
00:17:42.320 a part of one operation and McAfee gave
00:17:45.039 it a name Operation Shady Rat in 2013
00:17:49.919 Mandant a cyber security focused
00:17:52.080 subsidiary of Google managed to get even
00:17:54.799 further they named the group behind the
00:17:56.960 operation as AP1 highlighting its size
00:18:00.080 and importance then they traced the
00:18:02.160 breadcrumbs left by the hackers it
00:18:04.480 turned out the people behind this AP
00:18:07.120 worked for a segment of the Chinese
00:18:08.799 military called People's Liberation Army
00:18:11.280 General Staff Department's Third
00:18:13.039 Department Second Bureau otherwise known
00:18:15.600 as Unit
00:18:17.799 61398 it was located in a military
00:18:20.400 building on the outskirts of Shanghai
00:18:22.559 several hundreds of people who worked
00:18:24.000 there were responsible for anything from
00:18:26.000 military reconnaissance and electronic
00:18:27.840 warfare to writing propaganda comments
00:18:30.000 on social media they were an integral
00:18:32.400 part of the Chinese army and acted like
00:18:34.640 that in every way from ironclad
00:18:36.960 discipline to incredible
00:18:39.400 resourcefulness except for one thing
00:18:42.080 operational security between Mandant
00:18:45.520 McAfee Kyle Wilho and possibly others a
00:18:49.200 lot of people managed to trace the rat
00:18:51.039 back to its nest and it wasn't because
00:18:53.440 the Chinese hackers were incompetent or
00:18:55.880 negligent it was because they just
00:18:58.240 didn't care
00:19:00.320 in the first years of Operation Shady
00:19:02.160 Rat they didn't use any of the tools to
00:19:04.400 mask their usage of Chinese internet
00:19:06.240 providers and their fingerprints were
00:19:08.480 all over the malware their attacks were
00:19:10.799 brazen and aggressive relying more on
00:19:13.360 the poor cyber security of the victims
00:19:15.280 than advanced subtrifuge the ones that
00:19:17.440 were there too it was just you know
00:19:19.120 siphon the data and FTP it back to China
00:19:21.520 right and I say FTP like not even using
00:19:23.840 encryption they're just like back to
00:19:25.600 China directly right um you know and so
00:19:28.799 stuff that we we just would not even
00:19:30.480 consider today there were job listings
00:19:32.960 the former employees would include the
00:19:34.640 hacking achievements in their CVs one
00:19:37.280 hacker even published a scientific paper
00:19:39.440 on his techniques they weren't subtle at
00:19:42.000 all all right if there's anything you'd
00:19:43.760 say about China it was like they didn't
00:19:45.520 care about being caught all right and
00:19:47.280 despite this attitude the attacks worked
00:19:50.240 terabytes of data were smuggled through
00:19:52.000 the rat caves and ended up in the hands
00:19:53.840 of Chinese officers but for what
00:20:00.320 it's intellectual property theft right
00:20:02.400 originally um you know their big goal
00:20:04.720 certainly through the mid2010s um was
00:20:07.039 technology transfer and intellectual
00:20:08.640 property theft that would include you
00:20:10.559 know access to a lot of new technologies
00:20:13.280 you know about up and cominging things
00:20:14.720 because if there's one thing that's
00:20:16.720 known it's it's very difficult to create
00:20:19.200 but it's very easy to replicate and
00:20:21.080 enhance which China has done time after
00:20:24.640 time so if you go back and read China's
00:20:27.520 5-year plans and they're very public
00:20:29.679 about these right in the you know the
00:20:31.840 what are we uh you know moving um
00:20:34.720 domestically to produce over the next 5
00:20:37.440 years and what what technologies are we
00:20:39.280 looking to advance you can overlay that
00:20:41.840 directly with their targets lockheed
00:20:45.039 Martin an American defense manufacturing
00:20:47.200 giant was one of the first victims of
00:20:49.280 the shady rat in 2007 a rat's cave was
00:20:52.720 dug into its servers in there laid the
00:20:55.360 plans for the F-35 the latest and most
00:20:58.320 advanced stealth fighter jet the world
00:21:00.240 has ever seen just several years later a
00:21:03.760 remarkably similar aircraft took off for
00:21:05.919 a test flight in China it was called
00:21:08.320 Shenyang
00:21:09.480 FC31 and people started to get
00:21:11.799 suspicious several leaked reports
00:21:14.080 already stated that the US military was
00:21:16.080 worried about its systems being
00:21:17.480 compromised but the military denied
00:21:19.679 everything it wasn't until 2015 when
00:21:22.000 documents leaked by Edward Snowden
00:21:24.320 confirmed the F-35 was stolen and not by
00:21:27.919 a daring maverick or an undercover
00:21:32.280 agent it was stolen by a person who just
00:21:35.520 sent a bunch of emails to a Loheed
00:21:37.120 Martin employee pretending to be his
00:21:39.360 coworker and this is just one
00:21:41.280 high-profile case that we're reasonably
00:21:43.120 certain about construction companies
00:21:45.360 like the South Korean one where the
00:21:47.120 attacks began industrial plants like the
00:21:49.840 one imitated by Kyle Woolho's experiment
00:21:52.720 other factories offices and institutions
00:21:55.919 countless intrusions that allowed China
00:21:58.000 to copy devices systems best practices
00:22:01.520 the rat was bringing home the lumber
00:22:03.280 that fueled the fire the blaze of
00:22:05.760 unprecedented economic growth mainland
00:22:08.159 economy grew by some 400% from 2000 uh
00:22:11.679 grown so fast almost on steroid the
00:22:14.240 country has not missed a single GDP
00:22:16.400 target this entire decade
00:22:23.039 there were attempts to confront China
00:22:24.799 we've agreed that neither the US or the
00:22:27.120 Chinese government will conduct or
00:22:29.039 knowingly support cyber enabled theft of
00:22:31.760 intellectual property argue with it
00:22:34.159 china's foreign ministry on Monday
00:22:35.760 called on the US to immediately withdraw
00:22:37.919 its charges even dragged the military
00:22:39.919 hackers into court wanted by the FBI
00:22:43.039 none of them worked the standard
00:22:44.880 response of Chinese officials has been
00:22:46.880 to vehemently deny that their country
00:22:48.880 conducts any offensive cyber operations
00:22:51.200 and then strike back with the old
00:22:52.640 logical fallacy as old as time if the US
00:22:55.760 conducts them why shouldn't we however
00:22:59.200 despite those claims the Chinese APS
00:23:01.919 started being more careful they began
00:23:04.320 employing the help of non-state actors
00:23:06.320 and masking their traffic giving their
00:23:08.400 operations at least a semblance of
00:23:10.559 plausible deniability the brazenness of
00:23:13.919 the attacks right um you know really
00:23:16.240 really drops and so one of the things
00:23:18.559 that we saw you know happen uh quite a
00:23:21.159 bit after that uh admonishment that very
00:23:24.480 public state level admonishment um is
00:23:27.039 that you know they they began routinely
00:23:29.520 using what we call redirectionctors
00:23:31.360 right so uh basically hopping through
00:23:34.320 some other country's infrastructure
00:23:36.000 instead of the attacks coming in many
00:23:37.840 cases just straight from China the shady
00:23:40.240 rat ended the old tools were no longer
00:23:42.880 adequate for the job the hackers had to
00:23:45.360 be more careful they couldn't go after
00:23:47.200 so many targets and the attacks had to
00:23:49.799 change the reasons for the attacks also
00:23:52.720 changed the purpose of maintaining
00:23:54.880 presence of building a reliable rat cave
00:23:57.679 was no longer to steal information it
00:24:00.240 was to maintain access in case there was
00:24:02.480 a need for it in the US critical
00:24:05.559 infrastructure is defined as the asset
00:24:08.159 systems and networks that are most
00:24:09.440 critical to our economy and our national
00:24:11.360 security and community well-being and
00:24:12.960 the like and presumably the end goal
00:24:14.799 there of course is to stop the
00:24:17.600 functioning of things that that are that
00:24:19.039 are important get in the way of
00:24:20.240 transportation logistics systems the
00:24:22.000 ability to communicate or the ability of
00:24:25.200 organizations you know loss of power and
00:24:27.520 things like that shady RAT was an
00:24:29.360 immensely important operation for China
00:24:31.360 for many reasons it supplied the Chinese
00:24:33.840 industry with all the trade secrets it
00:24:35.679 needed and it established China as a
00:24:37.919 major cybernetic
00:24:39.480 superpower but it also had a much more
00:24:41.760 insidious and much more profound
00:24:44.840 effect say you have a rat that has
00:24:47.200 access to a water plant not a virtual
00:24:49.520 one but a real plant somewhere in the
00:24:51.919 rural United States you had a cave
00:24:54.400 leading there for years and nobody
00:24:56.400 noticed you stole all the documentation
00:24:58.880 you needed copied the plant's blueprints
00:25:01.600 but the cave is still there in fact
00:25:04.799 there are lots of those caves leading to
00:25:06.960 many plants across the country water
00:25:09.600 sewage gas electricity all kinds of
00:25:12.880 infrastructure that are critically
00:25:14.559 needed for the functioning of an economy
00:25:17.279 what could be done with it what could be
00:25:19.679 carried through all those caves
00:25:22.080 you know when I was in government at in
00:25:24.320 the cyber security infrastructure
00:25:25.520 security agency uh we we used a nice
00:25:28.159 analogy that I think is still pertinent
00:25:30.080 which was at the time you know I'm
00:25:33.120 talking about the end of the last decade
00:25:34.640 Russia was sort of hurricanes and
00:25:37.039 tornadoes natural disaster and China was
00:25:39.520 climate change
00:25:50.720 most regular hackers can attack personal
00:25:53.000 devices small and large networks or
00:25:56.000 companies but when nation state hackers
00:25:57.919 go to work entire countries get
00:26:00.279 paralyzed millions of computers get
00:26:02.480 infected and massive infrastructure
00:26:04.880 projects get turned into
00:26:07.640 scrap that's what happened during the
00:26:09.679 Stuckset attack Operation Shady Rat or
00:26:12.080 the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia each
00:26:15.120 of these hacks had scale and
00:26:16.640 sophistication nobody could imagine
00:26:18.640 before and each of them were done by
00:26:20.320 countries who use cyber as a weapon of
00:26:22.159 war and this weapon will not be put back
00:26:24.080 into the box but how does that work what
00:26:26.159 can we learn about state hacker groups
00:26:27.760 and which of them are the most powerful
00:26:29.600 let's dive
00:26:31.799 in cyber armies can take all kinds of
00:26:34.640 shapes and forms depending on what
00:26:36.320 countries need them for for example some
00:26:38.480 of them work a bit like secret cyber
00:26:40.840 police a typical case of that is Ocean
00:26:43.520 Lotus a hacker group often associated
00:26:46.080 with the Vietnamese government it mostly
00:26:48.159 targeted Vietnamese citizens and
00:26:49.840 organizations whose views did not align
00:26:52.000 with the governments golden Falcon is
00:26:54.080 another such example it's been linked to
00:26:55.919 the government of Kazakhstan and
00:26:57.440 conducted an extensive cyber espionage
00:26:59.600 campaign against various Kazak nationals
00:27:02.159 both of them were also used to attack
00:27:03.840 neighbors and such attacks are
00:27:05.760 incredibly common all over the world
00:27:11.120 many countries are locked in pitch cyber
00:27:13.120 battles with their neighbors especially
00:27:14.799 in parts of the world where there's some
00:27:16.400 sort of armed conflict their cyber
00:27:18.240 armies often act as an arm of the
00:27:20.000 regular army typically tied to an
00:27:21.919 intelligence agency or two the United
00:27:24.159 Arab Emirates for example has been
00:27:26.080 accused of hacking into the phones of
00:27:27.679 the Amir of Katar the prime minister of
00:27:29.600 Lebanon and other officials of rival
00:27:31.679 countries and even hiring former US
00:27:33.840 cyber specialists to help with these
00:27:35.600 efforts another country to do this is
00:27:37.840 Israel for decades it fought wars with
00:27:40.400 surrounding countries and established a
00:27:42.559 powerful cyber army as a tool of its
00:27:44.559 military intelligence known as 8200
00:27:48.000 if Iran wants to be treated like a
00:27:50.080 normal country let it act like a normal
00:27:52.480 country and if the region wasn't
00:27:54.080 volatile enough Iran a major rival of
00:27:57.039 both Israel and UAE boasts a massive
00:27:59.760 cyber army of its own and conducts
00:28:01.679 offensive operations across the Middle
00:28:03.600 East the Iranians are unusually talented
00:28:06.240 in cyber war for some reason we don't
00:28:08.480 fully understand just recently they
00:28:10.799 attacked Emirati government systems
00:28:12.799 Israeli infrastructure and countless
00:28:14.960 other
00:28:18.840 targets one of the ways for Israel to
00:28:21.279 strike back against Iran's influence was
00:28:23.760 to team up with other countries that
00:28:25.440 find such attacks suboptimal stuckset
00:28:28.960 perhaps the most famous cyber attack
00:28:30.880 ever was most likely a collaboration of
00:28:33.200 US and Israeli intelligence agencies it
00:28:35.760 targeted Iran's nuclear production
00:28:37.440 facilities with a virus which physically
00:28:39.600 damaged some turbines what was created
00:28:42.240 with stuckset was not just an operation
00:28:46.000 to sabotage Iranian nuclear research it
00:28:48.960 was a new kind of weapon russia is also
00:28:52.159 often employing the help of allied
00:28:53.760 countries for example Ghostriter a
00:28:56.080 hacker group which conducted heavy
00:28:57.679 attacks against Ukraine Poland and the
00:28:59.679 Baltic states in support of Russians
00:29:01.679 invasions of Ukraine's territory has
00:29:03.679 been traced to Bellarusian secret
00:29:05.360 services who acted as proxies a cyber
00:29:08.080 army for hire and while stealing and
00:29:10.240 extorting money are activities often
00:29:12.159 associated with regular hacker gangs
00:29:14.320 it's not like some groups shy away from
00:29:16.080 these practices
00:29:20.000 enter North Korea and its Lazarus Group
00:29:22.640 a nation sponsored threat actor that was
00:29:24.960 pretty reliably tracked to the military
00:29:26.799 of the secluded state some say that
00:29:29.039 North Korean hackers are responsible for
00:29:31.039 nearly half of all cryptocurrency theft
00:29:33.679 worldwide for all intents and purposes
00:29:35.919 crypto theft is now a major part of the
00:29:37.919 economy of an entire country and not
00:29:40.080 only that North Koreans also conducted W
00:29:42.640 to Cry which cost $4 billion in losses
00:29:46.240 and hacked into Sony just because of the
00:29:48.159 film that made fun of North Korean
00:29:49.600 dictator Kim Jong-un they hate us
00:29:52.000 because they ain't us china has been
00:29:54.799 known to engage in massive amounts of
00:29:56.399 such hacking too although what they're
00:29:58.159 after isn't some crypto but rather
00:30:00.080 industrial secrets operation Shady Rat
00:30:02.559 it targeted companies and agencies
00:30:04.399 across the world vacuuming anything from
00:30:06.960 blueprints to medical records some say
00:30:09.120 it greatly helped the Chinese aerospace
00:30:10.720 industry allowing it to catch up on
00:30:12.480 decades of research you may have noticed
00:30:14.159 that the J31 the latest Chinese fighter
00:30:16.559 jet is remarkably similar to the
00:30:18.159 American F-35 coincidence well Snowden
00:30:21.039 leaks say that no not really okay now
00:30:24.480 it's time to talk about the countries
00:30:25.840 with the largest cyber armies israel
00:30:28.399 North Korea Iran and the United Kingdom
00:30:31.600 have all tried to reach this level they
00:30:33.679 invested massive resources into their
00:30:35.440 cyber armies and conducted some very
00:30:37.600 damaging operations but they're still a
00:30:39.840 shot away from the major league i'm of
00:30:41.760 course talking about the big
00:30:46.200 three one of them is Russia a country
00:30:49.039 whose cyber warfare roots go back to the
00:30:51.120 early cold war which sat on the edge of
00:30:53.039 developing its own rival to the internet
00:30:55.039 and which went to incredible lengths to
00:30:57.200 punch way above its economic weight on
00:30:59.360 the international scene a distinctive
00:31:01.200 feature of Russian state hackers is
00:31:03.039 their tendency to hide beyond the image
00:31:04.799 of regular petty cyber criminals
00:31:06.799 activists and criminal gangs maybe you
00:31:09.600 remember Fancy Bear also known as the
00:31:12.039 Pawnstorm and Strontium it terrorized
00:31:15.039 companies politicians and entire
00:31:17.200 countries across the world for years
00:31:19.440 pretending to be a ragtag group of
00:31:21.120 hackers cyber terrorism is real it's
00:31:24.159 coming from the highest levels of the
00:31:25.360 Russian government well they say they
00:31:26.480 would not necessarily be doing this
00:31:27.679 unless they thought they had a fluke now
00:31:29.840 we pretty much reliably know that Fancy
00:31:31.840 Bear was a project of Russian's military
00:31:33.679 intelligence unit
00:31:35.320 26165 and headed by a Lieutenant Colonel
00:31:38.000 of the Russian
00:31:40.840 Army there are a host of similar groups
00:31:43.360 across Russia in 2016 they hacked into
00:31:45.840 the Democratic National Committee to
00:31:47.360 steal some documents and influence the
00:31:49.120 presidential elections in 2017 they
00:31:52.240 attacked Ukraine the cyber weapon not
00:31:54.480 pious quickly spread paralyzing major
00:31:56.880 companies and causing more than 10
00:31:58.880 billion dollars in damage a lot of
00:32:01.120 variables contributed to Russia having
00:32:02.960 one of the most powerful cyber armies in
00:32:04.960 the world it had scientists intelligence
00:32:07.120 agents and military officials who all
00:32:09.200 helped and it practically legalized
00:32:10.880 hacking to create a generation of strong
00:32:12.799 cyber criminals so yeah we are probably
00:32:15.360 going to keep hearing about Russian
00:32:16.799 hackers for a long time
00:32:21.519 another major player in the world of
00:32:23.039 hacking is China and its history is very
00:32:25.679 different if Russian hackers roots go
00:32:27.600 back half a century China is a relative
00:32:29.760 newcomer to the
00:32:31.000 scene the country's establishment
00:32:33.440 started taking cyber warfare seriously
00:32:35.600 only in the 2000s and it experienced an
00:32:38.320 unparalleled rise ever since its early
00:32:41.120 days were marked by crude fishing you
00:32:43.120 couldn't distinguish from a regular
00:32:44.480 Nigerian prince email but then just
00:32:46.880 several years later they would strike
00:32:48.720 with some of the largest industrial
00:32:50.320 espionage campaigns in history we
00:32:53.039 already mentioned how it got its hands
00:32:54.559 on the data of American aerospace
00:32:56.679 manufacturers but that's just the tip of
00:32:58.960 the iceberg general Motors Google
00:33:01.919 Motorola DuPont and countless other
00:33:04.559 Western companies admitted being
00:33:06.399 breached by Chinese hackers at some
00:33:08.240 point and all of that in order to
00:33:10.080 support the growth of China's economic
00:33:11.919 power spare nothing how does China's
00:33:14.159 cyber army operate we know that it works
00:33:16.159 as a centralized force under the army's
00:33:18.320 command with its own units officers and
00:33:20.880 personnel but beyond that very little is
00:33:23.120 clear except for the fact that it
00:33:24.559 displays staggering levels of
00:33:26.200 sophistication insight and planning in
00:33:28.799 its operations one of the most famous
00:33:31.200 names associated with Chinese hackers is
00:33:33.600 Vault Typhoon vault Typhoon this is a
00:33:36.799 state sponsored Chinese hacking group
00:33:39.120 was looking at ways to disrupt critical
00:33:41.200 communications between US and Asia it's
00:33:44.640 been behind several major hacks one
00:33:46.880 bigger than the next a telling example
00:33:48.960 was unveiled just recently when the
00:33:50.799 typhoon hacked into major communications
00:33:52.799 infrastructure across the Pacific
00:33:54.799 tapping all the nodes US military and
00:33:57.039 commercial organizations used what they
00:33:58.880 mostly did is spying but they also kept
00:34:00.880 their hands on a kill switch which would
00:34:02.399 disable those networks in the case of
00:34:03.919 invasion into
00:34:06.600 Taiwan and we now come to a cyber army
00:34:09.280 that needs no introduction
00:34:12.530 [Music]
00:34:16.399 in fact it's not as much of a cyber army
00:34:19.199 as a whole ecosystem of armies that all
00:34:21.599 work under one command even if it's not
00:34:23.918 in full
00:34:25.159 synchronicity the US military literally
00:34:28.000 invented the internet so their rise to
00:34:30.159 the pedestal of the world's top
00:34:31.520 cyberpower is nothing but expected
00:34:34.239 however maintaining such status in a
00:34:36.560 world where every other country has a
00:34:38.079 hacker army of its own is not an easy
00:34:40.399 task
00:34:41.839 a sort of unifying structure that helps
00:34:44.000 the US government do that is the US
00:34:46.239 Cyber Command it unifies cyber forces of
00:34:49.199 various branches of the US military US
00:34:52.000 Army Navy Air Force and the Marines and
00:34:55.440 it has an estimated yearly budget of
00:34:57.359 over 13 billion just for comparison
00:35:00.640 that's almost the entire GDP of North
00:35:02.960 Korea
00:35:04.720 and the cyber command doesn't even
00:35:06.320 include the agencies you might associate
00:35:08.320 with state sponsored hacking the FBI the
00:35:11.200 CIA and
00:35:12.920 others so the cyber force Uncle Sam can
00:35:15.680 exert if he needs something hacked is
00:35:17.760 just incomprehensively massive and it
00:35:21.240 shows some of the biggest and most
00:35:23.839 sophisticated cyber attacks that have
00:35:25.920 ever been conducted were traced to the
00:35:27.839 US intelligence agencies one example of
00:35:30.720 that is Operation Glowing Symphony a
00:35:33.359 case in 2016 when the US agencies hacked
00:35:36.160 into almost every single computer ISIS
00:35:38.400 used and took them all down at once
00:35:40.560 wiping out communication intelligence
00:35:42.880 and media of an entire emerging state
00:35:45.599 and when ISIS tried to recover gather
00:35:47.839 its resources and create new
00:35:49.599 communication systems the US would just
00:35:51.680 do that again and again and again this
00:35:55.280 is just one example of countless
00:35:57.520 incredibly sophisticated offensive
00:35:59.440 campaigns the US conducted there are so
00:36:01.839 many we know about and probably many
00:36:04.240 many more we don't this is not just
00:36:06.320 about the Chinese this is about the
00:36:08.079 Russians this is about the Iranians
00:36:10.240 these are all our potential adversaries
00:36:12.640 who understand the things that underpin
00:36:15.280 Western liberal democracies and are
00:36:18.320 going after it that's what keeps me
00:36:20.000 awake the reach of the United States
00:36:22.160 cyber army is sublime all inspiring and
00:36:25.359 a terrifying sight to behold
00:36:40.240 us officials say there's no indication
00:36:42.560 it is carrying the beginning of a
00:36:44.079 nuclear war will be announced on the
00:36:46.920 news the beginning of a cyber war most
00:36:50.640 likely will not in fact when it begins
00:36:55.040 there will be no news at all the first
00:36:58.320 thing you'll notice is that the
00:36:59.599 television no longer works the radio too
00:37:02.720 the internet is also down and while
00:37:04.720 we're at it you probably can't turn on
00:37:06.480 your TV at all the electricity is gone
00:37:10.079 the water and the central heating are
00:37:11.760 gone too if you're lucky if you're not
00:37:14.720 your faucet is blasting poisonous
00:37:17.000 chemicals and the heating pipes have
00:37:19.119 blown up and flooded the entire
00:37:20.640 neighborhood with boiling water
00:37:22.880 the hospitals the schools and every last
00:37:25.760 business are down public transport is
00:37:28.400 down too and you won't get very far in a
00:37:31.480 car it's the apocalypse we all know from
00:37:34.400 the movies but it wasn't caused by a
00:37:36.480 zombie virus an asteroid or a giant
00:37:39.880 monster it was caused by several
00:37:42.240 welltargeted cyber attacks on critical
00:37:45.400 infrastructure there's only one thing
00:37:47.440 that can match the devastation of such
00:37:49.359 an attack a good old nuclear strike for
00:37:53.440 decades they were the sum of all fears
00:37:55.680 and now we're slowly starting to fear
00:37:57.760 cyber attacks even more and this has
00:38:01.079 some
00:38:03.079 implications so here's the story of how
00:38:05.520 the world is going cyber
00:38:08.850 [Music]
00:38:13.800 mad the scenario we just discussed is
00:38:16.720 horrific but it's also surprisingly
00:38:19.200 plausible
00:38:20.800 to pull off such an attack an army of
00:38:23.040 hackers has to infiltrate several
00:38:24.880 crucial systems we all depend on and
00:38:27.280 take them down is it plausible well the
00:38:30.800 experts think so so if I were going to
00:38:33.520 do something I would attack power and
00:38:35.440 water i would also attack communications
00:38:37.680 and I would attack banking i'd go after
00:38:39.920 your physiological needs then I'd go
00:38:41.440 after your safety and security needs and
00:38:43.359 then I would compound that then with
00:38:45.200 additional attacks so for it to be
00:38:47.280 effective and to achieve what you want
00:38:48.880 it's not always necessarily destroying
00:38:50.880 something but if I can throw a society
00:38:53.920 into chaos is it going to be a case
00:38:56.079 where you know you drop a nuclear bomb
00:38:57.599 and all of a sudden you know there's a
00:38:58.880 city decimated well no but it it could
00:39:03.119 absolutely cause a city to become
00:39:05.359 decimated in another way you know where
00:39:07.760 there's there's no services as you
00:39:09.599 mentioned the water's all turned off you
00:39:11.680 know or you know heaven forbid a nuclear
00:39:14.400 power plant is is shut down and has a
00:39:16.480 meltdown then then you could have you
00:39:18.400 know even tremendous disasters kind of
00:39:20.960 like the nuclear bomb type things but a
00:39:23.040 single cyber attack could take out
00:39:24.640 critical infrastructure for an entire
00:39:26.400 country that would be very difficult to
00:39:29.839 successfully uh launch an attack of that
00:39:32.800 scale but I think it is absolutely
00:39:34.880 possible sure an all-out cyber war isn't
00:39:38.000 as devastating as a full-fledged nuclear
00:39:40.160 war but rebuilding civilization from
00:39:42.560 such a massive infrastructure takedown
00:39:44.720 wouldn't be an easy task either all the
00:39:47.760 information you store in digital form is
00:39:50.079 gone bank records personal records every
00:39:53.920 last bit of financial information that
00:39:55.839 makes markets work the world would
00:39:58.240 descend into chaos for years if not
00:40:00.560 decades until some semblance of economy
00:40:03.200 can be restored it's a scenario no one
00:40:06.079 would like to experience regular people
00:40:08.400 would lose the comfort of their lives
00:40:10.000 and the prospect of a bright future
00:40:12.480 companies would lose countless billions
00:40:14.240 in revenue and governments would face
00:40:16.400 the risk of complete implosion
00:40:18.960 this total cyber war seems like
00:40:21.040 something we should really try to avoid
00:40:23.359 it's in everybody's best interest to
00:40:25.119 keep attackers out of their
00:40:26.320 infrastructure and secure it as much as
00:40:28.320 possible right so are we there
00:40:36.599 yet successful attacks on critical
00:40:39.200 infrastructure do happen a lot in May
00:40:43.560 2023 Microsoft revealed that
00:40:45.839 communication networks across the
00:40:47.520 Pacific were infiltrated by a Chinese
00:40:49.680 state hacker group known as Vault
00:40:51.800 Typhoon it tapped major communication
00:40:54.320 nodes and stayed there vacuuming crucial
00:40:57.119 intelligence data on the surface it was
00:41:00.000 a successful spying effort which also
00:41:02.640 had an additional effect the attackers
00:41:05.839 did all they could to gain full control
00:41:07.680 of the networks without being detected
00:41:10.240 which means they had their finger on the
00:41:12.319 shutdown button for months may 2023 a
00:41:16.400 Danish cyber security watchdog detected
00:41:18.720 a massive attack against the country's
00:41:20.760 infrastructure it caught Sandworm a
00:41:23.359 hacking arm of Russian military
00:41:24.960 intelligence which broke into 22
00:41:27.119 companies that were responsible for
00:41:28.800 managing power plants transmission
00:41:30.720 networks and distribution centers
00:41:33.680 part of the attack was stopped but not
00:41:36.160 all of it for a brief period the
00:41:38.560 Russians took over the majority of
00:41:40.079 Denmark's electricity grid and had a
00:41:42.640 chance to shut it down whenever they
00:41:44.599 wanted in February 2024 a leak of
00:41:47.920 internal documents by ISON a Chinese
00:41:50.400 spyware manufacturing company was posted
00:41:53.000 online among thousands of documents were
00:41:55.920 logs showing the company's employees
00:41:57.920 infiltrated LGU+ the second largest
00:42:01.119 mobile network provider in South Korea
00:42:04.160 once again the attackers were inside the
00:42:06.560 company where they could do unspeakable
00:42:08.400 damage possibly shutting down
00:42:10.480 communications across South
00:42:12.440 Korea but they didn't those hackers who
00:42:16.800 breached the Danish electricity grid
00:42:18.960 they didn't try to shut it down either
00:42:21.839 and Volt Typhoon who had a capability to
00:42:24.319 disable the entire US communications
00:42:26.560 infrastructure in the Pacific never
00:42:28.800 pressed the button these are just three
00:42:31.640 examples a lot more get reported every
00:42:34.400 week and how many never get
00:42:37.160 reported by the way painting it as just
00:42:39.839 a feature of Russia and China is not
00:42:41.839 entirely fair there's more than enough
00:42:44.000 evidence that the United States and its
00:42:45.760 allies are conducting offensive cyber
00:42:47.760 operations of their own but being a bit
00:42:50.480 more quiet about it
00:42:53.040 do I think we have the same capability
00:42:54.800 absolutely will we hear about it uh only
00:42:56.880 when there's only when something bad
00:42:59.440 happens you never hear about the good
00:43:00.800 stuff you only hear when something goes
00:43:02.400 wrong not when something goes right so
00:43:04.960 the US and the West is often very quiet
00:43:07.520 about their cyber offensive capabilities
00:43:10.640 um but we are starting to see more of
00:43:12.480 that come to light the first publicly
00:43:15.040 known offensive cyber op of the United
00:43:17.359 States was conducted by US Cyber Command
00:43:19.839 and that was in December of 2021 we also
00:43:22.880 just recently heard confirmation from
00:43:24.880 General Nakasoni who spearheaded the US
00:43:27.760 Cyber Command in June 2022 he said that
00:43:30.880 the US was in fact conducting cyber ops
00:43:33.440 against Russia in support of Ukraine we
00:43:36.400 often see that the US is disrupting and
00:43:39.359 dismantling cyber operations of our
00:43:41.520 adversaries um so those are typically
00:43:44.000 the strategic goals of the US and other
00:43:46.160 countries I would say is they're trying
00:43:47.960 to keep adversaries out and maintain a
00:43:51.599 strong defensive posture uh more so than
00:43:54.319 trying to cause any harm to their
00:43:56.200 adversaries uh persistence is incredibly
00:43:59.119 important in cyber operations
00:44:02.240 let's stop here for a bit have you
00:44:04.480 noticed this word
00:44:06.680 persistence it's an incredibly important
00:44:09.200 part of modern large-scale cyber
00:44:11.440 operations and it's what separates your
00:44:13.680 regular cyber criminals from the big
00:44:16.200 guys rogue regimes criminals of every
00:44:19.599 flavor activists and the like they
00:44:22.480 attack critical infrastructure as well
00:44:24.560 and they often try to do as much damage
00:44:26.400 as possible sometimes they even succeed
00:44:30.079 but their gains are temporary and even
00:44:32.400 though they sometimes cause millions of
00:44:34.240 dollars in damage that's peanuts in
00:44:36.319 comparison to a full-fledged cyber war
00:44:39.359 to wage that you need
00:44:42.040 persistence it's an ability to not only
00:44:44.800 break into a system not only steal data
00:44:47.839 from it but stay inside without being
00:44:50.880 detected
00:44:52.400 a regular cyber criminal would
00:44:54.079 compromise the system and immediately
00:44:56.240 exploit it for profit stealing data and
00:44:58.800 trying to sell it encrypting everything
00:45:00.960 and demanding ransom or just vandalizing
00:45:03.760 the place but for a hacker army backed
00:45:06.800 by a major state blowing perfectly good
00:45:09.520 access on just one attack is a bit
00:45:12.359 wasteful keeping a low profile and
00:45:14.960 maintaining access in case they want to
00:45:17.119 carry out an attack in the future would
00:45:19.119 seem like a much better strategy so
00:45:21.839 where does this leave us a world where
00:45:24.240 major powers are constantly trying to
00:45:26.400 get into the position where they can
00:45:27.920 cause harm to their adversaries but stop
00:45:30.560 just short of doing that because harm is
00:45:34.160 not their priority being able to cause
00:45:37.359 that harm is a lot more
00:45:40.119 important wait isn't this something
00:45:42.720 we've already seen in the past
00:45:45.359 let's go back far far back all the way
00:45:49.359 back to the
00:45:51.000 1800s this is Hyram Maxim a British
00:45:54.319 American engineer who invented the
00:45:56.160 curling iron the fire sprinkler an
00:45:58.880 airplane that lands on rails and a cure
00:46:01.359 for asthma that doesn't work but those
00:46:04.560 aren't the inventions that made him
00:46:05.839 famous he was immortalized thanks to
00:46:08.599 this a machine gun a device that killed
00:46:12.240 millions of people with industrial
00:46:14.920 efficiency and when he was told that his
00:46:17.200 invention was going to make wars even
00:46:19.040 more dreadful he replied that no it's
00:46:22.480 going to make wars
00:46:24.520 impossible supposedly this weapon would
00:46:27.359 be so horrible so devastating that no
00:46:30.400 one would willingly attack a power that
00:46:32.240 wielded it or even use it against other
00:46:34.640 human beings and if both sides of the
00:46:37.119 conflict wielded the machine gun nobody
00:46:39.520 would start a war peace ensues this is
00:46:42.960 the concept of mutually assured
00:46:45.240 destruction maxim was not the first to
00:46:47.680 refer to it and far from the last during
00:46:51.440 the Cold War these letters became the
00:46:53.599 main political and military strategy
00:46:55.680 major countries
00:46:57.079 adopted some say this is the only reason
00:47:00.000 World War II never happened or at least
00:47:02.319 not in the way World Wars happened
00:47:03.920 before
00:47:05.200 maybe this is true maybe not all we know
00:47:08.720 is that the leading superpowers believed
00:47:10.720 it to be true and that's why it worked
00:47:14.160 the world changed a lot since then
00:47:16.560 nuclear fears are still there but for a
00:47:19.040 lay person they're not really on the
00:47:20.880 agenda anymore social security numbers
00:47:22.800 of 143 million Americans may have been
00:47:26.079 exposed
00:47:27.839 that spot is occupied by the anxieties
00:47:30.400 of the cyber age don't click on random
00:47:33.359 links is the new duck and cover could it
00:47:36.640 be that infiltrating the infrastructure
00:47:38.720 of your adversary staying there keeping
00:47:41.599 your hand on the button and waiting for
00:47:43.599 a chance to strike is the way countries
00:47:45.760 are doing the arms race now yeah what a
00:47:49.800 cliffhanger by the way recently our
00:47:52.319 explainers are getting a lot of
00:47:53.760 attention which helps our animators
00:47:55.760 editors writers and other people deliver
00:47:58.400 more and better content
00:48:00.880 this is why we can't thank you all
00:48:02.640 enough for engaging with our content
00:48:04.960 your feedback is what keeps us going so
00:48:07.200 don't hesitate to leave it if you feel
00:48:08.960 like we should make more of this stuff
00:48:13.240 thanks let's admit it we don't know if
00:48:16.160 the scenario of mutually assured
00:48:17.839 destruction really works and we for sure
00:48:21.040 don't know if major cyberpowers consider
00:48:23.200 it important nowadays
00:48:25.440 nuclear deterrence involves countries
00:48:27.760 openly stating that they won't hesitate
00:48:29.760 to destroy the planet if attacked
00:48:36.079 we know a lot about that and nobody
00:48:37.760 hides this fact cyber deterrence is
00:48:40.720 different on paper most countries claim
00:48:43.520 they will stop attackers by protecting
00:48:45.359 their networks with the best security
00:48:47.119 practices possible no country openly
00:48:49.599 states it will take offensive cyber
00:48:51.200 action if attacked but it could be that
00:48:53.520 some countries or at least the capable
00:48:55.839 ones go one step beyond
00:48:59.760 i think um that all of the any kind of
00:49:02.559 government entity is trying to poise
00:49:04.559 themselves so that they're in a better
00:49:06.559 position right they want to be able to
00:49:08.000 have access to critical infrastructure
00:49:10.400 so that in the case that they might need
00:49:12.319 to launch an attack that they know they
00:49:15.040 will be successful um and more
00:49:16.960 importantly they want to make sure that
00:49:18.400 they can garner the information required
00:49:21.119 to be strategic and successful in cyber
00:49:23.599 warfare state sponsored actors would
00:49:25.520 probe uh let's say the Department of
00:49:26.960 Defense information networks um so
00:49:29.920 basically they try to find ways to break
00:49:32.000 into those firewalls so they're doing
00:49:33.920 probes you know if I go in and do this
00:49:36.160 am I able to get in um if I'm not why
00:49:38.960 not you know so it's not just go do it
00:49:41.520 and oops that failed it's it's learning
00:49:43.599 as you're doing it like why am I being
00:49:47.040 you know pushed back here why was the
00:49:49.680 firewall able to withstand my efforts
00:49:51.680 here well oh I can get through this way
00:49:54.559 which explains a lot of attacks we
00:49:56.319 discussed when Sandworm attacked the
00:49:58.559 Danish power grid they had nothing to
00:50:00.559 spy on and may not even want it to
00:50:02.960 establish persistence all they wanted to
00:50:05.520 see is how far they can get but what
00:50:09.680 happens if the probing goes a bit too
00:50:11.920 far how do you know when to stop boy
00:50:15.680 wouldn't uh wouldn't that be something
00:50:17.280 if we all knew the answer to that um you
00:50:19.680 know where they the the the probing and
00:50:21.839 testing ends and the real stuff begins
00:50:24.400 um it's anyone's guess as to which is
00:50:26.960 which um you know how far will a person
00:50:32.440 team nation state etc go if they're
00:50:36.280 probing actually does what it was
00:50:38.720 intended to do however drawing a direct
00:50:41.680 parallel between the mutually assured
00:50:43.440 destruction we saw with nukes and the
00:50:45.599 situation we see in cyerspace is
00:50:48.119 tricky cyberspace is vast and complex
00:50:51.760 there are many actors many players and
00:50:54.480 many ways everything can go wrong know
00:50:58.000 that mutually assured destruction works
00:50:59.839 as well in cyerspace because you've got
00:51:02.079 different actors the chess board is
00:51:03.680 different it's set up differently so
00:51:05.119 many more people can participate
00:51:07.200 mutually assured destruction worked when
00:51:08.960 the players were wellknown the rules of
00:51:10.559 engagement were well known and the
00:51:12.240 consequences were wellknown we still
00:51:13.920 don't really know the consequences of
00:51:15.440 what happens in cyerspace
00:51:17.760 what what's the threshold you know is
00:51:20.000 there are there criteria that are
00:51:21.760 established none of this exists yet you
00:51:23.680 know it's it's um uh so common to see
00:51:28.160 these cyber attacks right now that you
00:51:30.640 know you can't say any cyber attack
00:51:32.720 means you're attacking my country
00:51:33.839 because then every country would already
00:51:35.280 be at war with each other because it's
00:51:36.720 been going on for quite a while uh so
00:51:38.960 that's certainly not the case um but you
00:51:41.839 know when if you shut things down does
00:51:43.839 that become well things have been shut
00:51:45.599 down and that didn't do um so so the
00:51:48.480 threshold of what becomes the
00:51:50.880 declaration of war from a cyerspace
00:51:53.640 attack is needs to be ultimately defined
00:51:58.160 I think um and and cuz without it you're
00:52:01.760 really going to have this ambiguous kind
00:52:03.839 of where are we what does this mean
00:52:06.559 achieving a full-fledged cyber attack
00:52:08.800 the worst case scenario is also much
00:52:11.119 more difficult than it seems breaking
00:52:13.760 into one communication network or one
00:52:15.920 telecom provider is possible and even
00:52:18.400 then you never know when you could be
00:52:20.400 detected and kicked out of there but
00:52:22.960 breaking into all of them at once that's
00:52:25.280 a much more difficult
00:52:27.000 task um you know there's a lot of things
00:52:30.800 that have to go right in order to
00:52:33.040 achieve this mutually assured
00:52:35.480 destruction how do you attack all of
00:52:37.599 that at the same time it will take an
00:52:39.920 immense amount of resources to achieve
00:52:42.720 this mutually assured
00:52:45.520 um effort i think that maybe we're
00:52:49.200 working towards that we don't even know
00:52:50.960 it i do believe that the larger
00:52:53.280 governments in the world are capable of
00:52:55.200 launching a successful attack such as
00:52:57.280 that uh but they don't want that
00:53:00.319 reciprocated on themselves um that's the
00:53:03.280 reason why the US Russia and China are
00:53:06.319 so incredibly strategic and persistent
00:53:09.200 in their cyber attacks right now is
00:53:11.520 because they want to know what their
00:53:12.960 adversaries are doing so that they are
00:53:15.200 also prepared if they may have to
00:53:17.040 respond to such a large-scale attack on
00:53:20.000 one hand the fact that a full-fledged
00:53:22.079 cyber war with faucets spewing poison
00:53:24.240 and electrical networks going haywire is
00:53:26.480 not looking too plausible is reassuring
00:53:29.680 with everything going on in the world
00:53:31.599 and the shadow of nuclear annihilation
00:53:33.760 still hanging above us we certainly
00:53:36.000 don't need one more Armageddon
00:53:38.359 scenario however is this really a good
00:53:42.280 thing after he invented the machine gun
00:53:45.200 Hyram Maxim thought it was so powerful
00:53:47.760 it would bring world peace it did not
00:53:51.200 instead it brought even more pain and
00:53:53.800 misery we might just be seeing the same
00:53:56.480 story repeating with cyber weapons if
00:53:59.119 countries do not see attacks on
00:54:00.640 themselves as serious enough of a threat
00:54:03.200 they might be a lot more eager to use
00:54:04.880 their capabilities and cause more
00:54:06.880 destruction in the
00:54:17.480 process june 1984 NSA Washington campus
00:54:21.839 Fortme Maryland a small parking lot near
00:54:24.640 operations building 3 a line of trucks
00:54:26.960 comes in and stops by several unmarked
00:54:29.680 trailers out of the trucks workers begin
00:54:32.319 unloading huge packages covered in
00:54:34.480 plastic and burlap one by one the
00:54:37.200 packages are carried into one trailer
00:54:39.280 then another to get here these packages
00:54:42.400 have traveled a long way they came from
00:54:45.200 Moscow
00:54:46.680 USSR inside one of these packages was a
00:54:49.760 tiny device smaller than a pencil this
00:54:52.960 device was the focus of an entire secret
00:54:55.280 operation which only a handful of NSA
00:54:57.920 specialists even knew about a counter
00:55:00.079 intelligence effort so secret most
00:55:02.480 people involved in it had no idea how it
00:55:04.640 worked and this effort would become the
00:55:07.280 granddaddy of all the cyber operations
00:55:09.520 of the United States intelligence
00:55:11.359 agencies all the surveillance all the
00:55:14.079 hacking all the cyber attacks stuckset
00:55:17.200 eternal blue equation everything began
00:55:21.119 right here in this parking lot with
00:55:24.319 project
00:55:27.590 [Music]
00:55:30.200 gun the story begins several months
00:55:32.800 earlier it's the height of the Cold War
00:55:35.119 nuclear standoff Berlin Wall spy games
00:55:38.000 all the usual stuff the entire world was
00:55:40.960 split in two with one exception
00:55:43.960 embassies both the Soviet Union and the
00:55:46.720 United States had these small patches of
00:55:48.720 land in each other's territories and no
00:55:51.280 they weren't officially considered
00:55:52.480 foreign soil but it was the closest you
00:55:54.559 could get to that the American Embassy
00:55:56.640 in Moscow was a massive Stalinist Gothic
00:55:59.200 building in the middle of the city 10
00:56:01.200 floors of America less than 2 miles from
00:56:03.520 the Red Square not only was it a
00:56:05.760 diplomatic link between the US and the
00:56:07.599 Soviet Union all the spying went through
00:56:09.920 there too so as you might imagine those
00:56:12.160 10 floors were chock full of secrets the
00:56:14.480 Soviets were very eager to get their
00:56:16.079 hands on and they tried constantly the
00:56:19.200 building was erected in the ' 50s and
00:56:21.040 for decades after that the staff kept
00:56:23.359 finding recording devices embedded in
00:56:25.359 the furniture the walls the concrete
00:56:27.280 beams basically everywhere on a roof
00:56:30.400 across the street the Soviets even
00:56:32.319 mounted a massive emitter that would
00:56:34.000 blast the embassy with microwaves some
00:56:36.480 say it was an unsuccessful attempt to
00:56:38.000 give the American staff cancer a more
00:56:40.079 realistic version was that the Soviets
00:56:42.079 were remotely charging all the
00:56:43.440 surveillance equipment hidden inside the
00:56:45.640 embassy nobody had any illusions that
00:56:48.000 the building wasn't full of bugs but
00:56:49.920 finding all of them or at least knowing
00:56:51.760 what and how they recorded was crucial
00:56:54.400 the lives of American spies all across
00:56:56.400 the USSR depended on that though
00:56:59.119 sometimes the staff would get some help
00:57:01.760 for example in 1983 French and Italian
00:57:04.640 diplomats found some bugs hidden in
00:57:06.400 their teletype machines basically
00:57:08.319 typewriters that work remotely the
00:57:10.880 French tipped off the Americans hinting
00:57:12.720 that similar bugs were likely in their
00:57:14.480 teletypes
00:57:16.040 too the devices were extremely
00:57:18.799 complicated for the period just hundreds
00:57:21.040 of pounds of electronics you could not
00:57:23.280 hope for a better place to hide a small
00:57:25.599 recorder okay teletypes were probably
00:57:28.079 bugged what else the embassy was full of
00:57:30.799 similar electronic equipment computers
00:57:33.280 radio devices even typewriters tons of
00:57:35.839 the stuff literal metric tons and
00:57:38.880 somehow you had to look for those bugs
00:57:40.799 without raising any suspicions because
00:57:42.880 if the Soviets caught wind that you were
00:57:44.720 looking for the bugs they could
00:57:46.000 temporarily remove or disable them even
00:57:49.359 President Ronald Reagan was invested in
00:57:51.200 the mission he signed off on it
00:57:52.720 personally and gave the task of finding
00:57:54.640 the bugs in the embassy's equipment to
00:57:56.640 the one man who could do it right Walter
00:57:59.200 G dy NSA's deputy director of
00:58:01.680 communication security in fact he was
00:58:04.160 given the job after personally
00:58:05.760 contacting Reagan and offering himself
00:58:08.160 and his agency it's important to point
00:58:10.480 out that back in the 80s the NSA wasn't
00:58:12.640 this massive boogeyman of a federal
00:58:14.240 institution we see today it was formed
00:58:16.559 in the 50s out of previous counter
00:58:18.160 intelligence efforts and was basically
00:58:20.079 tasked with all kinds of signal
00:58:21.680 monitoring yeah cryptographic this and
00:58:23.920 radiographic that looked very cool back
00:58:26.000 then but nobody took them very seriously
00:58:28.799 at least until 1983 when dealing came
00:58:31.520 forward and told Reagan "We can find
00:58:34.160 that damn bug." We can assume Reagan
00:58:37.119 liked the attitude now all that was left
00:58:39.839 was to find the damn thing but before
00:58:42.400 that let me tell you about this episode
00:58:44.079 sponsor you that's right we can do these
00:58:47.040 videos purely because of your support
00:58:48.720 right here on YouTube your likes
00:58:50.799 subscribes and comments help move us
00:58:52.960 forward so
00:58:55.000 yeah thanks okay back to the 10-story
00:58:58.799 embassy in Moscow the NSA wanted to get
00:59:01.359 the bugged equipment out of the embassy
00:59:03.040 without raising any suspicions so it
00:59:05.119 came up with a story that the tech was
00:59:07.119 getting upgraded in reality they didn't
00:59:09.920 upgrade anything they just bought a
00:59:11.680 direct duplicate of all the equipment
00:59:13.359 and flew it to the USSR the old
00:59:15.920 equipment then had to be packed up and
00:59:17.760 sent back to the US which was easier
00:59:19.839 said than done there were 10 tons of it
00:59:22.799 and those teletype machines they were
00:59:25.160 massive when the Soviets noticed that
00:59:27.520 the American staff was bringing in the
00:59:29.200 new upgraded stuff they turned off the
00:59:31.520 electricity for the entire building for
00:59:33.839 you know maintenance so the elevators
00:59:36.160 were out of the question and the 10 tons
00:59:38.160 had to be carried by hand up and down
00:59:41.119 through the entire building the staff
00:59:43.440 collected all the equipment on one floor
00:59:45.359 and packed it with special tamperproof
00:59:47.200 bags the only place to get those bags
00:59:49.280 was the US so if the Soviets ever tried
00:59:51.599 to remove a secret bug from the
00:59:53.359 equipment transport the NSA would have
00:59:55.440 no difficulty in finding that out
00:59:57.839 finally the equipment was transported to
00:59:59.839 an airport then flown to Frankfurt and
01:00:02.720 then to Washington DC okay what's next
01:00:06.240 you have to look through it somehow it's
01:00:08.319 awfully complex there are transistors
01:00:10.400 upon transistors so how do you find that
01:00:13.119 one ship that does not
01:00:15.400 belong basically De created this setup
01:00:18.960 he put two large trailers in a parking
01:00:21.200 lot near the NSA headquarters one of the
01:00:23.920 trailers was for a portable X-ray
01:00:25.599 machine the technicians would take each
01:00:27.920 piece of equipment out of the bag and
01:00:29.760 X-ray it then in another trailer a
01:00:32.559 technician would painstakingly compare
01:00:34.640 the photo with a schematic of the same
01:00:36.799 part trying to find discrepancies the
01:00:39.280 project was marked VRK very restricted
01:00:42.720 knowledge which is one of those super
01:00:44.720 strict above top secret designations
01:00:46.880 whose very existence wasn't even known
01:00:48.880 until the '90s if back then you even
01:00:51.119 mentioned this three-letter combination
01:00:52.880 the NSA people would pretend you were
01:00:54.559 talking nonsense and that would be the
01:00:56.400 last thing you ever did or as De himself
01:00:58.880 put it VRK means that he'll cut off your
01:01:01.839 private parts if you breathe a word
01:01:03.359 about what you're doing so there were
01:01:05.680 around 25 agents on the job supervised
01:01:08.000 by DIY and a couple other top dogs
01:01:10.400 nobody else knew about Project Gunman
01:01:12.400 not even the embassy staff back in
01:01:14.079 Moscow for them it was just another
01:01:16.400 equipment upgrade in Washington the
01:01:19.040 people worked shift after shift through
01:01:21.119 nights and weekends just hours after
01:01:23.440 hours of comparing photos with
01:01:25.040 schematics in a cramped trailer until
01:01:27.680 one day one employee looked at a photo
01:01:30.240 and saw this and we actually know what
01:01:33.119 he said at that exact moment he said
01:01:36.760 "Holy." It was a cross-section of this
01:01:39.280 aluminum bar in a typewriter a small bar
01:01:41.920 that basically doesn't allow the machine
01:01:43.440 to break in half it was just crammed
01:01:46.240 with electrical parts that did not
01:01:48.079 belong there somebody took a metal bar
01:01:50.640 hollowed it out and stuffed it full of
01:01:54.280 electronics
01:01:56.040 holy the way it worked is actually
01:01:58.240 pretty interesting the typewriter wasn't
01:02:00.319 your typical grandma clack clack thing
01:02:02.240 that you see in spine movies it was an
01:02:04.240 IBM Select Electric 2 a sophisticated
01:02:07.079 electromechanical machine with lots of
01:02:09.119 moving parts after you pressed a key it
01:02:11.680 would move a small lever called an
01:02:13.359 interposer the lever would move some
01:02:15.599 other levers and all of that would move
01:02:18.000 this small ball with metal letters on it
01:02:20.480 the ball would rotate and press an inked
01:02:22.720 piece of film into the paper the
01:02:24.960 movements of those parts was incredibly
01:02:27.119 minuscule and precise truly a typewriter
01:02:30.240 for the space age so how do you record
01:02:32.760 that well you put an array of tiny
01:02:35.680 magnetometers into this bar basically
01:02:38.559 they're devices that sense the proximity
01:02:40.480 of magnets each time a magnetized lever
01:02:43.200 comes by a magnetometer gets triggered
01:02:46.400 the signals would then be transmitted to
01:02:48.240 a small microchip for encoding this part
01:02:50.720 is really quite fascinating the Soviets
01:02:52.799 didn't have a memory device that could
01:02:54.240 hold multiples of six so exactly 30 36
01:02:57.280 or 42 bits 32 was all they had so this
01:03:01.119 encoder would compress a 6- bit message
01:03:03.440 into a 4-bit one as soon as that memory
01:03:06.319 got filled up its contents would be sent
01:03:08.319 through a miniature antenna to be picked
01:03:10.319 up by a larger antenna on the embassy's
01:03:13.160 roof the sophistication of the whole
01:03:15.520 thing by 80s standards was just off the
01:03:17.839 charts the NSA had no idea that the
01:03:19.839 Soviets were capable of creating
01:03:21.359 anything like that let alone secretly
01:03:23.520 installing it in embassy equipment and
01:03:25.599 if that wasn't a wake-up call the NSA
01:03:28.000 didn't know what was
01:03:33.920 and here's where we encounter James R
01:03:36.160 gosler a man many regard as the
01:03:38.480 godfather of American cyber war gosler
01:03:41.520 didn't work on Project Gunman directly
01:03:43.280 but he was in the NSA at the time a few
01:03:45.920 years later he became the director of
01:03:47.599 the clandestine information technology
01:03:49.680 office at the CIA which was the AY's
01:03:52.319 first attempt to go allin on cyber and
01:03:55.039 when a New York Times journalist asked
01:03:56.880 Osler about the importance of Project
01:03:58.559 Gundamman to the American spy efforts he
01:04:00.960 said there were basically two eras
01:04:03.119 before Gunman and after Gunman in the BG
01:04:06.799 era nobody took the NSA seriously the
01:04:09.280 CIA didn't employ cyber espionage at all
01:04:11.920 and everybody was still in the cold war
01:04:14.000 mode of sending James Bond types
01:04:15.920 whenever some spying was needed an
01:04:17.920 interesting example of the American
01:04:19.359 espionage effort from this era was
01:04:21.280 Operation Monopoly which happened before
01:04:23.680 Project Gunman back in the 70s tell me
01:04:26.079 if it sounds familiar the Soviet Union
01:04:28.400 had just built a new embassy in
01:04:29.839 Washington DC and the American
01:04:31.599 government thought it would be a really
01:04:33.039 good idea to plant some bugs in it just
01:04:34.799 to have a sneak peek but instead of
01:04:36.720 spicing up Soviet typewriters they began
01:04:39.039 digging a tunnel under the embassy yeah
01:04:41.839 they hired a contractor bought a
01:04:43.520 neighboring lot and began digging a
01:04:45.200 tunnel to get to the embassy and spy on
01:04:47.280 it that way the Soviets quickly caught
01:04:49.440 wind of what they were doing the tunnel
01:04:51.119 had to be abandoned and Operation
01:04:52.799 Monopoly was a massive
01:04:54.839 failure operation Gunman was a slap in
01:04:57.440 the face to the NSA the CIA and all the
01:05:00.240 other AS the Soviets were planning these
01:05:02.480 super high-tech bugs while the Americans
01:05:04.720 were digging tunnels so De Gosler and a
01:05:08.240 lot of other very important people got
01:05:09.839 together and decided enough is enough
01:05:12.559 their spying game had to get to a new
01:05:15.079 level and that's how we are where we are
01:05:17.520 now you have things like Stuckset a
01:05:19.920 little piece of malware that destroyed
01:05:21.280 Iran's nuclear program and that the CIA
01:05:23.599 spent over a billion dollars to develop
01:05:26.720 you have massive surveillance programs
01:05:28.400 that suck up intelligence about
01:05:30.000 everything and everybody and you have
01:05:32.319 not a hacker army but an entire
01:05:34.559 ecosystem of hacker armies that all work
01:05:37.200 in
01:05:39.559 unison so yeah while most of the history
01:05:42.400 of the American cyber warfare is
01:05:44.079 classified maybe the most important
01:05:46.400 story the inciting incident is the one
01:05:48.960 thing we do know about and that's
01:05:51.520 Project Gunman
01:06:04.160 may 30th 1989 a forest outside of
01:06:07.200 Hanover West Germany a couple police
01:06:09.440 officers arrive to investigate reports
01:06:11.359 about an abandoned car on a remote road
01:06:14.240 as the officers scan the forest around
01:06:16.160 it they stumble upon something
01:06:17.920 horrifying a pile of bones in the middle
01:06:20.240 of a few feet of charred ground human
01:06:23.559 bones somebody burned a body here it was
01:06:26.640 done carefully to avoid a forest fire in
01:06:28.799 the middle of a heat wave but still
01:06:30.799 thoroughly enough to get rid of any
01:06:32.640 identifying information the bones
01:06:34.640 belonged to a man named Carl Coch at the
01:06:37.200 time of his death he was 23 years old
01:06:39.599 worked as a driver had a severe drug
01:06:41.520 addiction and suffered from serious
01:06:43.680 mental issues carl Kch also had an alter
01:06:46.480 ego he was known as Hagbard a hacker who
01:06:49.760 conducted the very first cyber espionage
01:06:52.000 operation in history along with a small
01:06:54.480 group of friends he broke into hundreds
01:06:56.319 of computers belonging to major defense
01:06:58.640 contractors factories institutions
01:07:01.599 research organizations and laboratories
01:07:04.079 all across the world he stole thousands
01:07:06.160 of cuttingedge scientific documents from
01:07:08.240 reports about missile trials to
01:07:09.920 microchip schematics to nuclear research
01:07:12.480 data but here's the catch carl and his
01:07:14.960 friends were tracked down to do that the
01:07:17.440 authorities had to pretty much invent
01:07:18.960 the modern field of cyber forensics
01:07:21.039 after a few years and some luck both the
01:07:23.359 FBI and the German police had the
01:07:25.520 hackers under surveillance not willing
01:07:27.520 to spend the rest of his days on the run
01:07:29.359 Carl approached the police and confessed
01:07:31.119 he was questioned and put under witness
01:07:33.119 protection 2 months later his remains
01:07:35.280 were found in a forest near Hanover
01:07:37.440 believe it or not that's only a
01:07:38.720 minuscule part of the first known case
01:07:40.720 of international cyber espionage hold on
01:07:43.280 tight because the deeper you go the
01:07:44.880 wilder things get and to begin with we
01:07:47.760 have to talk about Operation Shower
01:07:51.319 Head let's go back a few years 1986
01:07:55.200 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in
01:07:57.240 California this is the nerve center for
01:07:59.520 the American scientific community the
01:08:02.319 internet as we know it did not exist yet
01:08:04.960 instead there was this bunch of tangled
01:08:06.799 networks that universities and other
01:08:08.720 research institutions used to share data
01:08:11.200 and resources and Berkeley had some of
01:08:13.760 the best computing power this side of
01:08:16.158 the Pacific physicists chemists
01:08:18.719 astronomers and the like from all across
01:08:20.880 the US would hook up to the lab through
01:08:22.799 one or another network to crunch numbers
01:08:24.880 whenever needed mind you this level of
01:08:27.679 compute was not cheap so the laboratory
01:08:30.238 would charge its users for each second
01:08:32.560 the records were kept tight and one day
01:08:35.359 the staff noticed a slight error
01:08:37.520 somebody used the computers but did not
01:08:39.759 pay for 9 seconds of their time 75 cents
01:08:43.120 ah I'm sure it's nothing serious
01:08:44.719 compared to the time the undergrads
01:08:46.319 probably wasted using those
01:08:47.679 supercomputers to play Pong or whatever
01:08:49.679 right the staff put one of its junior
01:08:51.520 workers on the task of figuring out the
01:08:53.198 discrepancy the worker's name was
01:08:55.120 Clifford Stole he was an astronomer who
01:08:57.679 found himself out of a job and took up
01:08:59.520 computer maintenance as a temporary gig
01:09:01.799 75 they must be joking right here's a
01:09:04.960 laboratory full of equipment worth
01:09:06.640 millions upon millions of dollars and
01:09:08.880 they have Cliff chasing 75 he was
01:09:12.080 overqualified that's for sure and he
01:09:14.319 found the issue in no time a user didn't
01:09:16.479 fill out his billing address a user
01:09:18.560 named Hunter curious but well they had
01:09:21.759 the culprit problem solved hunter got
01:09:24.000 booted out of the system and that's the
01:09:26.158 end of that but the next day another
01:09:28.158 user began causing problems an account
01:09:30.399 belonging to a well-established
01:09:31.920 professor tried breaking into a closed
01:09:33.839 off network coincidentally the professor
01:09:36.238 was out on sbatical weird cliff could
01:09:39.279 just kick him out like he did Hunter but
01:09:41.359 something told him not to he began
01:09:43.520 tracking the account and by tracking I
01:09:45.839 mean Cliff connected printers to every
01:09:48.000 telephone line going into the building
01:09:49.920 so that he'd have a print out of all the
01:09:51.759 activity throughout the night yeah he
01:09:54.320 used dozens of printers as an endpoint
01:09:56.880 detection device that's some ingenuity
01:09:59.600 when the morning came the printouts
01:10:01.679 horrified Cliff the account of the
01:10:03.920 professor was stolen that's a no-brainer
01:10:06.560 but more than that the account had taken
01:10:08.800 control of the entire laboratory network
01:10:11.679 the hacker who snatched the account
01:10:13.600 conducted what would nowadays be called
01:10:15.920 privilege escalation he used a weird
01:10:18.719 vulnerability a specially crafted email
01:10:21.360 forced the central server to make the
01:10:23.199 hacker a super user the main
01:10:25.600 administrator of the whole network if
01:10:28.480 that looks like an enormous security
01:10:30.159 oversight to you you're not alone this
01:10:32.400 story was checked by one of our
01:10:33.600 researchers here at Cybernews and he
01:10:35.440 could not believe his eyes but believe
01:10:37.760 it or not it is true back in the 80s
01:10:40.320 cyber security just wasn't a thing and
01:10:42.560 emailing administrator privileges looked
01:10:44.320 like a neat idea thanks to stories like
01:10:46.560 these we now know that it was very naive
01:10:49.199 and very dangerous and if you want to
01:10:51.360 hear more of them please subscribe to
01:10:53.040 our channel because as long as enough of
01:10:54.719 you do that we won't have to put
01:10:56.239 sponsored segments into our videos no
01:10:58.719 this isn't extortion not at all anyway
01:11:01.520 back to the story as it turned out that
01:11:03.760 privilege escalation wasn't the first
01:11:05.679 time for the hacker he'd already done
01:11:07.679 that before with other aliases too
01:11:10.080 hunter Jerger Benson Hedges it turned
01:11:14.000 out that for this hacker breaking into
01:11:15.840 Berkeley was a routine because he didn't
01:11:18.480 just use the lab for its computing power
01:11:20.560 no he did something a lot grander you've
01:11:24.080 probably heard about ARPANET the
01:11:25.679 prototype of the modern internet it was
01:11:28.080 one of the networks Berkeley was
01:11:29.520 connected to and by far the largest
01:11:32.320 every scientific institution that
01:11:33.920 mattered was connected to ARPANET
01:11:35.840 through it scientists would conduct
01:11:37.520 calculations on Berkeley's computers
01:11:39.600 share their findings cooperate on
01:11:41.360 research and do other important things
01:11:43.760 because who would steal their super
01:11:45.760 secret research from a specialized
01:11:47.679 computer network right somebody was
01:11:50.480 stealing the research all of it the
01:11:52.400 hacker Hunter was using a whole Swiss
01:11:54.159 Army knife of vulnerabilities to infect
01:11:56.239 hundreds of computers across the United
01:11:58.159 States he basically took over Arponet
01:12:01.199 but that was not enough for Hunter from
01:12:03.440 Arpanet he hopped onto Milnet and the
01:12:06.320 theft of scientific data suddenly began
01:12:08.719 looking like child's play milnet was a
01:12:11.120 section of Arpanet used by the military
01:12:13.440 in 1983 they separated the two networks
01:12:16.000 so that Professor Einstein over there
01:12:17.920 couldn't just accidentally connect to a
01:12:19.760 nuclear silo by punching in an incorrect
01:12:22.080 code but the networks weren't completely
01:12:24.640 separate there were computers you could
01:12:26.400 use to jump between them and that's
01:12:28.800 exactly what Hunter did now not
01:12:31.679 everything was as bad as it seemed you
01:12:33.600 couldn't use Milnet to launch missiles
01:12:35.280 or give orders to nuclear bombers or
01:12:37.679 whatever else the paranoid media from
01:12:39.280 the8s imagined this program has access
01:12:42.159 to every computer system in the country
01:12:44.560 and it thinks for itself but even so it
01:12:47.760 was still a bit of a problem when Cliff
01:12:49.520 discovered Hunter hopping off to Milnet
01:12:51.520 he contacted the military sometimes
01:12:53.440 going as far as calling the actual bases
01:12:55.360 the hacker was exploring at the moment
01:12:57.360 and their response was "Why should we
01:12:59.679 listen to you?" The really sensitive
01:13:01.280 stuff is secure anyway if something
01:13:03.040 could be hacked it's probably not that
01:13:04.800 important some grueling weeks later
01:13:07.120 Cliff managed to convince the FBI to
01:13:09.040 take him seriously and investigate the
01:13:10.880 intrusions but they had no resources to
01:13:13.440 catch the hacker cliff would have to do
01:13:15.280 that himself no pressure it took quite a
01:13:18.000 bit of time but eventually Cliff figured
01:13:20.000 it out he did that by mapping Hunter's
01:13:22.560 activities on Arpanet and then tracing
01:13:24.640 him backwards to his hiding spot the
01:13:26.960 hacker used Berkeley as one of his bases
01:13:28.960 of operations and to connect to it he
01:13:31.360 used timeet another huge computer
01:13:33.600 network cliff followed the timeet
01:13:35.760 connection to some major telecom
01:13:37.199 providers and right across the Atlantic
01:13:39.280 to West Germany turns out Hunter had
01:13:41.760 another base of operations at the
01:13:43.360 University of Braymond but nobody
01:13:45.199 noticed the accounting errors there and
01:13:46.960 he got into Braymond through a local
01:13:48.560 phone line using a modem yeah this guy
01:13:52.400 was good very good here's the thing
01:13:55.280 remember those TV shows from the 90s
01:13:57.199 where they tried to trace the location
01:13:58.719 of a phone call and to do that they had
01:14:00.960 to stay on the line with the caller for
01:14:02.480 minutes on end otherwise the trace would
01:14:04.400 be lost well that's actually how it
01:14:06.719 worked and the reason for that was this
01:14:09.280 the phone networks were
01:14:11.239 electromechanical technicians had to use
01:14:13.280 voltmeters to measure hundreds of relays
01:14:15.360 to find out which one you were connected
01:14:17.040 through the tech was rudimentary and
01:14:18.960 they would have to do the same to trace
01:14:20.719 Cliff's hacker except it would take
01:14:22.880 hours but Cliff did not have hours
01:14:26.239 because Hunter usually connected to
01:14:28.080 Berkeley for just several seconds at a
01:14:30.080 time and then hopped off to somewhere
01:14:31.920 else cliff would have to convince him to
01:14:34.080 stay on the line for as long as possible
01:14:36.640 but how well the man wasn't a
01:14:38.800 professional programmer but he did have
01:14:40.640 lots of creativity and he was not afraid
01:14:42.719 to use it so he launched Operation
01:14:45.600 Shower Head yes just in case you're
01:14:47.679 curious he did come up with it in the
01:14:49.280 shower and it still makes more sense
01:14:51.120 than most government naming conventions
01:14:52.960 those modem connections were slow at the
01:14:55.120 time really slow downloading a text
01:14:58.239 document could take hours and Cliff knew
01:15:00.560 that Hunter was specifically after
01:15:02.480 documents secret documents he gobbled up
01:15:05.360 anything connected to missiles lasers
01:15:07.840 any sci-fi sounding thing he could find
01:15:10.080 so Cliff created his own documents about
01:15:12.320 missiles and lasers through the weekend
01:15:14.719 he conjured up an entire library of fake
01:15:17.280 paperwork about the Strategic Defense
01:15:19.760 Initiative better known as Project Star
01:15:22.320 Wars it was Reagan's super advanced
01:15:24.640 missile defense effort that was the talk
01:15:26.480 of the town back in the day cliff's
01:15:28.640 documents were just a pile of
01:15:30.320 bureaucratic gibberish with every
01:15:32.320 scientific mumbo jumbo buzzword he could
01:15:34.320 muster he typed out a pile of these
01:15:36.640 documents uploaded them to Berkeley's
01:15:38.560 computers and just like that a technique
01:15:41.040 known as the cyber honeypot was invented
01:15:44.560 cyber security professionals use it to
01:15:46.400 this day and it's essential for modern
01:15:48.480 law enforcement most of the hacker
01:15:50.320 arrests you see in the news are made
01:15:51.840 thanks to honeypotss but in the 80s that
01:15:54.320 was just not a thing yet and Cliff was
01:15:56.239 the one who came up with the idea while
01:15:58.400 standing in his shower and the hacker he
01:16:00.640 took the bait he saw a strategic defense
01:16:03.040 initiative in the title and began
01:16:04.880 pumping the documents through his
01:16:06.320 bleeping and tripping modem one
01:16:08.320 excruciating line at a time the German
01:16:10.800 telephone technicians grabbed their
01:16:12.159 voltmeters and went to town on those
01:16:13.679 relays and several hours later the
01:16:16.320 police had the address where Hunter
01:16:17.920 lived and that's where most retellings
01:16:20.000 of this story usually end hunter turns
01:16:22.320 out to be a team of German teenagers
01:16:24.159 they get arrested german police find out
01:16:26.239 they worked for the KGB and were selling
01:16:28.560 the stolen documents to the Soviets for
01:16:30.400 huge sums of money enda but that's just
01:16:34.239 the first half of the story because as
01:16:36.719 Cliff was tracing his hacker another
01:16:38.880 even bigger drama was unfolding out
01:16:40.719 there in Germany a drama chalk full of
01:16:42.960 hacking drugs and rock and roll that
01:16:45.760 drama later became known as Project
01:16:50.199 Equalizer welcome to Chaos Computer Club
01:16:54.560 to this day it's the largest association
01:16:56.800 of hackers in Europe basically if you
01:16:58.960 merge Anonymous with the Pirate Party
01:17:00.719 then multiply it by the Defcon
01:17:02.320 Conference and put it in Europe you get
01:17:04.480 the Chaos Computer Club in the early 80s
01:17:07.120 this organization tried to unite all
01:17:08.960 hackers or computer freaks as they were
01:17:10.960 known at the time it also preached the
01:17:13.040 ideas of open sourcing freedom of
01:17:14.960 information and sticking it to the man
01:17:17.360 all of that with the anarchist bent of
01:17:19.199 people who survived purely on the light
01:17:21.040 of CRT monitors underground techno music
01:17:23.760 the smell of soldering and whatever
01:17:25.840 substance they might have been
01:17:26.960 distributing under the table chaos
01:17:29.199 Computer Club no word in that name was
01:17:31.920 taken lightly chapters of the club
01:17:33.840 popped up all across Germany spreading
01:17:35.760 their cyberpunk message in 1985 such a
01:17:39.040 chapter opened in Hanofa well a chapter
01:17:41.840 is a big name for what was just a couple
01:17:43.440 guys in a local bar those guys were
01:17:46.159 named Dob and Hagbard dob real name Dirk
01:17:51.040 Otto Brazinski was a brilliant
01:17:53.040 programmer in his late 20s extremely if
01:17:55.520 not obscenely well- paid he had a day
01:17:58.000 job freelancing for some of Germany's
01:17:59.840 finest tech companies a gray suit a
01:18:02.159 well-lit office and a life that bored
01:18:04.400 him to no end hagbar was the polar
01:18:06.880 opposite his real name was Carl Kac and
01:18:09.920 he grew up in an abusive family which
01:18:11.840 left quite an imprint on him both of his
01:18:14.239 parents died of cancer and left a
01:18:16.239 substantial inheritance hagbar did his
01:18:18.640 best to waste that on computers drugs
01:18:21.120 and partying soon several more people
01:18:23.679 joined this small club hans Hinrich
01:18:25.920 Hubna nicknamed Pango was a hacker
01:18:28.400 cowboy from Berlin when the local
01:18:30.400 computer freaking scene turned out to be
01:18:32.080 too boring for him he sought friends
01:18:33.920 elsewhere and ended up in Hanofa marcus
01:18:36.560 Hess nicknamed Ukl was a physics student
01:18:39.280 who got into computers by moonlighting
01:18:41.040 for a local startup and got absolutely
01:18:43.120 bewitched by them there was also Peter
01:18:45.040 Carl Pedro who had nothing to do with
01:18:47.360 hacking but he was their drug dealer and
01:18:49.840 just liked to hang around smart people
01:18:51.840 these guys were some of the best
01:18:53.360 programmers in the country but there's
01:18:55.199 no doubt who was the soul of the gang it
01:18:57.760 was Hagbird everyone described him as
01:19:00.480 almost a prophet a genius who radiated
01:19:03.120 the spirit of the age unlike the others
01:19:05.760 he had no background in programming he
01:19:07.840 was completely self-taught and preferred
01:19:10.080 brute force above anything else there
01:19:12.800 are legends about him almost
01:19:14.239 supernaturally guessing passwords and
01:19:16.400 smelling
01:19:17.560 vulnerabilities if the first attempt at
01:19:19.679 hacking didn't work Hagbar would try
01:19:21.840 again and again and again spending days
01:19:25.679 by the computer and consuming a crazy
01:19:27.679 amount of whatever mindbending cocktail
01:19:29.679 Pedro supplied there was one more thing
01:19:32.560 about Hagbart he was obsessed with a
01:19:34.640 book this one the Illuminatus Trilogy a
01:19:38.880 sort of main character of this book is
01:19:40.880 named Hagbard Seline that's the
01:19:43.040 inspiration for Carl's handle in the
01:19:45.440 book Hagbard is a reclusive hero who
01:19:47.760 travels the world in a golden submarine
01:19:49.679 with a crew of outcasts and a
01:19:51.679 supercomput of his own design hagbar's
01:19:53.920 life has one purpose: fighting the
01:19:56.520 Illuminati the history of the world is
01:19:58.800 the history of the warfare between
01:20:00.560 secret societies this is an epigraph
01:20:03.120 that opens up the book and it sums the
01:20:05.199 thing up perfectly the setup is simple
01:20:07.840 the world is controlled by a conspiracy
01:20:10.080 an evil cabal that runs humanity as
01:20:12.239 material for their dark experiments they
01:20:14.719 worship devils play with governments and
01:20:17.040 seek to bring about the apocalypse only
01:20:19.600 heroes like Hagbar can foil their plans
01:20:22.239 they fight the Illuminati and managed to
01:20:24.480 beat them at their own game the
01:20:26.080 Illuminatus book was extremely important
01:20:28.400 to Carl he named himself after the
01:20:30.560 protagonist and his computer after the
01:20:32.480 one in the book and he took its
01:20:34.560 teachings extremely seriously he was
01:20:37.440 absolutely sure the world was run by the
01:20:39.360 Illuminati and by gosh he would dedicate
01:20:41.920 his life to fighting them the book's
01:20:43.520 philosophy also worked well with the
01:20:45.280 ideas of Chaos Computer Club they were
01:20:47.440 anarchists digital punks fighting
01:20:49.440 against whatever authority there was for
01:20:51.840 freedom for all the club hagbar and his
01:20:54.960 friends agreed information can't belong
01:20:57.280 to governments or corporations it should
01:20:59.360 belong to everybody and if some people
01:21:02.080 have difficulty accessing it that access
01:21:04.400 has to be provided by any means
01:21:06.400 necessary basically they created the
01:21:08.560 philosophy of modern computer pirates
01:21:10.719 but there was a huge challenge for this
01:21:12.400 philosophy the internet in its modern
01:21:14.880 form did not exist back in the mid80s
01:21:17.199 people from all across the world could
01:21:19.040 not just use their personal devices to
01:21:20.880 find whatever they want no matter how
01:21:22.800 good they were at hacking the Soviet
01:21:24.719 Union was the perfect illustration of
01:21:26.400 this it was behind the Iron Curtain and
01:21:28.960 didn't have access to Western
01:21:30.239 technologies although it tried to create
01:21:32.320 a sort of unified computer network that
01:21:34.719 ended up in failure and compared to the
01:21:36.800 US and Europe the number of personal
01:21:39.040 computers in the USSR was minuscule
01:21:41.760 whatever computers the Soviets had were
01:21:44.000 either smuggled in from the West or a
01:21:45.920 decade behind the curve hagbard and his
01:21:48.000 friends weren't communists not at all in
01:21:50.640 fact the Illuminatus books described
01:21:52.719 communism as just another project of the
01:21:54.880 Illuminati along with rock and roll and
01:21:57.120 recreational drug use but helping the
01:21:59.760 people of communist countries even if
01:22:01.760 done through the government was another
01:22:03.600 matter entirely so the group decided to
01:22:06.080 become digital Robin Hoods by that time
01:22:08.400 they formed a welloiled hacking machine
01:22:10.239 that could breach almost any system
01:22:12.320 powered by the technical talents of the
01:22:14.080 three brilliant programmers fueled by
01:22:16.000 Pedro's drugs and inspired by Hagbart's
01:22:18.719 preachings lo and behold they launched
01:22:21.600 Project Equalizer but they still faced
01:22:24.719 one question how do you actually go
01:22:26.719 about helping the Soviets from West
01:22:28.880 Germany at first Pedro the one with the
01:22:31.280 people skills just went to the Soviet
01:22:33.199 embassy and offered the group services
01:22:35.440 that did not work then Hagbar tried his
01:22:38.639 luck to prove his worth he threw
01:22:40.960 together a demo of sorts a bunch of
01:22:43.040 carefully researched information about
01:22:44.960 American computer networks the pathways
01:22:47.120 the hackers could access and the systems
01:22:49.199 they were capable of breaking into there
01:22:51.600 were passwords that opened up access to
01:22:53.280 Milnet the Pentagon NASA but to keep the
01:22:56.639 Soviets hooked Hagbar decided to hide
01:22:59.280 them to get those passwords the KGB
01:23:02.000 would have to pay a million German marks
01:23:04.400 and not a penny less you see the money
01:23:07.360 Hagbar inherited from his parents had
01:23:09.520 long since been squandered the earnings
01:23:11.360 of programmers were huge by the
01:23:13.040 standards of the day but their appetites
01:23:15.199 for drugs and tech were larger the guys
01:23:17.920 were broke and while their vigilante
01:23:20.480 ambitions ran wild they needed money
01:23:22.960 fast hagbart and his friends traveled to
01:23:25.280 East Berlin and approached a KGB officer
01:23:28.000 his name was Ske and he was a KGB
01:23:32.239 officer as you can guess convincing him
01:23:34.639 to trust a bunch of young drugged up
01:23:36.239 hackers was not easy and on top of that
01:23:39.120 he had difficulty grasping how a
01:23:40.880 computer network even worked let alone
01:23:42.639 understanding what hacking meant also a
01:23:45.280 million marks this kind of money was
01:23:47.679 just out of the question hagbart's plan
01:23:50.000 to give the Soviets the military
01:23:51.440 passwords didn't work he had to settle
01:23:53.920 for less so on their next trips to East
01:23:56.000 Berlin the hackers brought whatever
01:23:57.840 important sounding data they could find
01:23:59.920 nuclear research information on missile
01:24:02.159 tests scientific papers on physics and
01:24:04.760 astronomy later they began transferring
01:24:07.199 programs industrial software operating
01:24:09.520 systems even malware the hackers would
01:24:11.679 burn that on magnetic tape and bring it
01:24:13.679 to Sergey he would give the tape to his
01:24:15.840 technicians for checking and if the
01:24:17.760 information appeared to be worthwhile to
01:24:19.360 them the hackers would get paid at home
01:24:21.520 they would use a modem connection at
01:24:22.800 Hagbar's dingy old apartment siphon the
01:24:25.440 information through the phone line that
01:24:26.880 was as slow as it was unreliable they
01:24:29.280 would use time net to connect to the
01:24:30.960 University of Braymond then hop across
01:24:33.120 the Atlantic and through some more steps
01:24:35.199 and land at Berkeley nothing could stop
01:24:37.760 them nothing but the KGB because after a
01:24:42.080 few trips east the scientific papers no
01:24:44.480 longer cut it passwords to the Pentagon
01:24:46.800 would have been nice but for those
01:24:48.639 Hagbar demanded a million marks they had
01:24:51.199 to find a compromise and Sergey gave a
01:24:54.000 hint the KGB would be extremely grateful
01:24:57.280 if the hackers could provide anything on
01:24:59.760 the strategic defense initiative the
01:25:02.639 infamous Star Wars project this was the
01:25:05.600 time when Cliff Stole discovered Hunter
01:25:07.520 on Berkeley's network and in truth that
01:25:09.920 was a bit of a happy coincidence project
01:25:12.320 Equalizer was in peril the tightlyknit
01:25:14.719 group of hackers began falling apart
01:25:17.360 some of the guys were wary of the spy
01:25:19.040 games they got dragged into others had
01:25:20.880 qualms about doing it for the money and
01:25:23.120 everybody got sick of Hagbar's
01:25:25.040 Illuminati obsession you see here's the
01:25:27.440 thing about this book from all we know
01:25:29.600 Hagbard Carl saw it as an adventure
01:25:32.400 novel based on some true facts well it
01:25:35.199 certainly looked like that with its
01:25:36.639 references to documents and real world
01:25:38.560 events but in reality it was a parody a
01:25:42.400 parody of conspiracy theories cold war
01:25:44.560 paranoia and everything in between the
01:25:47.120 authors worked in the press and kept
01:25:48.880 receiving these letters where people
01:25:50.320 would write about worldwide secret
01:25:51.920 societies Freemasons flying saucers
01:25:54.400 communist agents satanic cults and the
01:25:56.520 Illuminati well it was basically Twitter
01:25:58.880 before Twitter existed the book was
01:26:00.880 written on one premise what if all these
01:26:03.199 nuts are right and every single
01:26:05.360 conspiracy theory they complain about
01:26:07.280 really exists but if the eventual
01:26:09.360 appearance of the internet proved any
01:26:11.040 one thing it's that any parody no matter
01:26:13.520 how extreme can be taken for a real
01:26:16.080 thing and that's how Hagbar took it as
01:26:19.120 we now know he had serious mental issues
01:26:21.760 and obsessive drug use that pumped that
01:26:23.760 up this is not to diminish Hagbar's
01:26:26.000 skill as a hacker by all accounts he was
01:26:28.000 a genius but he was a deeply disturbed
01:26:30.719 individual and there was a price to pay
01:26:32.560 for his talents the team began
01:26:34.639 fracturing they no longer cooperated got
01:26:37.199 sloppy and stopped cleaning up their
01:26:39.040 tracks they began leaving accounting
01:26:41.120 errors in the systems they used at the
01:26:43.360 same time Cliff found their traces at
01:26:44.880 Berkeley the guys were also discovered
01:26:46.560 by the engineers of CERN and possibly by
01:26:49.040 some of the other victims sensing the
01:26:50.960 impending doom Hagbar threw one last
01:26:53.360 Hail Mary he found some new documents on
01:26:55.840 the strategic defense initiative on
01:26:57.600 Berkeley Systems just what the Soviets
01:26:59.840 wanted right you can imagine what
01:27:02.159 happened later soon after falling into
01:27:04.400 the Star Wars honeypot Hagbar noticed
01:27:06.719 something frightening he was being
01:27:08.239 tracked the German police were onto him
01:27:10.639 and there was no way to escape he
01:27:13.199 decided to give up and in a few days he
01:27:15.520 contacted the authorities and told them
01:27:17.520 everything about Project Equalizer and
01:27:19.760 that was the real end of the world's
01:27:21.679 first cyber espionage operation hagbar
01:27:24.400 got into witness protection his friends
01:27:26.400 were arrested and Project Equalizer
01:27:28.639 along with Operation Showerhead became
01:27:31.040 history what happened next is hard to
01:27:34.120 discuss a week later Hagbar's charred
01:27:36.960 bones were found in a forest near Hanova
01:27:39.440 an official investigation was launched
01:27:41.360 and concluded Carl Kak had taken his own
01:27:44.400 life by self emulation yes the
01:27:46.960 circumstances of his death look
01:27:48.400 incredibly fishy and we can doubt the
01:27:50.560 official conclusion as much as we want
01:27:52.719 but Carl's friends for some reason they
01:27:55.280 don't doubt it according to them before
01:27:57.679 the end Carl got disillusioned with
01:27:59.760 everything his plot to help the Soviets
01:28:01.920 did not work his war on the Illuminati
01:28:04.239 appeared to be pointless and the same
01:28:06.159 government he tried to fight was now
01:28:08.480 protecting him from the KGB
01:28:34.040 that's Fast forward a couple decades and
01:28:36.719 some of the people involved with Project
01:28:38.480 Equalizer became famous hackers and
01:28:40.560 security researchers in their own right
01:28:42.800 none of them were as famous as Clifford
01:28:44.320 stole though the man who caught them
01:28:46.480 between a best-selling book countless
01:28:48.320 lectures and a documentary with glorious
01:28:50.880 live reenactments someone named Spentech
01:28:57.320 spenc Hagbard also became a legend he
01:29:00.719 got a bittersweet techno song dedicated
01:29:02.560 to him and a German film with painfully
01:29:05.199 '90s hacking
01:29:06.679 scenes but what immortalized all of
01:29:09.199 these people more than anything was the
01:29:11.280 techniques they created project
01:29:13.280 Equalizer was truly the first
01:29:15.360 international cyber espionage operation
01:29:17.600 in the world and Operation Showerhead
01:29:20.159 laid the groundwork for every counter
01:29:22.159 espionage effort that came after
01:29:37.170 [Applause]
01:29:40.639 welcome to North Korea the land of
01:29:43.679 military parades an occasional famine
01:29:47.120 this guy his nukes the most spectacular
01:29:50.639 technological failures and the world's
01:29:53.679 most powerful hackers they have the
01:29:56.719 capability not only to infiltrate but
01:29:58.880 potentially to destroy data and system
01:30:01.719 wait uh this can't be right when it
01:30:05.520 comes to technology North Korea often
01:30:07.679 looks stuck back in the 1960s how can
01:30:10.560 this country have anything to do with
01:30:13.159 hacking well it's a complicated story
01:30:16.000 and one in which a lot of things aren't
01:30:18.239 like they seem we might even say there
01:30:20.800 is some deception going on like a play
01:30:24.320 so welcome to the North Korean
01:30:31.340 [Music]
01:30:33.320 theater if you were around a few years
01:30:35.600 ago you probably saw this this is Axi a
01:30:39.920 fluffy creature from Axi Infinity a
01:30:42.239 video game that's supposed to be your
01:30:43.760 chance to earn real money while playing
01:30:45.840 it was all the rage at the height of the
01:30:47.440 NFT craze millions of people played it
01:30:50.080 some even dropped their real jobs for
01:30:52.280 that and in March 2022 those players
01:30:55.679 began experiencing something strange it
01:30:58.159 looked like a serious glitch some
01:30:59.840 functionality went down but surely
01:31:02.000 somebody would fix that quickly right
01:31:04.800 nobody could fix it you see the game got
01:31:07.600 so popular because it ties its in-game
01:31:09.520 money to Ethereum that Ethereum the
01:31:12.560 second biggest cryptocurrency after
01:31:14.320 Bitcoin these are not just in-game coins
01:31:17.120 they have a direct connection to real
01:31:18.800 world money a couple of conversions and
01:31:20.880 your coins turn into real cash the
01:31:23.920 exchange mechanism is quite complicated
01:31:26.239 but it relies on a user-friendly
01:31:27.760 platform called Ronin a special service
01:31:30.159 set up by the game's developers for easy
01:31:32.679 transfers and those problems experienced
01:31:35.040 by the players in March 2022 they had
01:31:37.840 everything to do with Ronin so yesterday
01:31:40.239 developers of the Ronin network
01:31:42.239 announced through a blog post that they
01:31:44.000 had discovered a hacker had stolen $540
01:31:47.440 million worth of cryptocurrency
01:31:50.320 it was hacked the whole system an
01:31:52.560 extensive network of computers put in
01:31:54.320 place to ensure that the game's
01:31:55.840 transactions were legitimate was taken
01:31:58.360 over that allowed hackers to steal 600
01:32:01.760 million worth of in-game currency from
01:32:03.920 the players then they converted that
01:32:05.920 currency into Ethereum and ran off all
01:32:08.800 that remained was to launder the money
01:32:11.040 $600 million at the time it was the
01:32:13.679 largest heist in history it's still the
01:32:16.400 largest heist if you consider how much
01:32:18.239 the currency was worth at the time
01:32:22.800 only sometime later were internet
01:32:24.480 sleuths professional investigators the
01:32:26.800 developers of Ronin and Axi and
01:32:28.719 everybody else were able to piece
01:32:30.400 together a picture of what happened and
01:32:32.880 all of them arrived at the same
01:32:34.600 conclusion who is the attacker well
01:32:37.199 you've probably guessed it north Korea
01:32:40.960 this North Korea a country that is the
01:32:43.440 butt of almost every joke on the planet
01:32:45.679 managed to steal $600 million from an
01:32:49.120 NFT game ask a random person on the
01:32:51.920 street how NFTs work and they're going
01:32:53.760 to struggle to explain it but North
01:32:55.920 Koreans they understood it well enough
01:32:57.840 to hack the entire system and get away
01:33:00.000 with hundreds of millions well you see
01:33:02.880 this wasn't North Korea's first rodeo
01:33:05.280 the country did some crime before no big
01:33:07.679 deal you might think countries sometimes
01:33:09.920 just do crime smuggling weapons forging
01:33:12.400 documents you know things like that
01:33:14.080 you've seen the movies you know how this
01:33:15.760 works nearly all countries dabble in
01:33:18.480 this at least a bit for all kinds of
01:33:20.320 reasons if they don't want big problems
01:33:22.080 they tread carefully and avoid overdoing
01:33:24.400 it but there is one country that just
01:33:26.400 does not care about
01:33:27.800 problems yes that's North Korea and when
01:33:30.800 you don't care about problems to the
01:33:32.239 North Korean degree crime can get a
01:33:34.400 little out of control
01:33:36.080 north Korea is absolutely without a
01:33:38.400 doubt in a league of its own when it
01:33:40.239 comes to breaking international law you
01:33:42.480 might think the one country you don't
01:33:44.159 like does it a lot but compared to North
01:33:46.480 Korea even that is peanuts the North
01:33:49.199 Koreans did it all trafficking weapons
01:33:51.440 and cigarettes poaching endangered
01:33:53.360 animals producing counterfeit drugs
01:33:55.679 illegal drugs very illegal drugs
01:33:58.239 trafficking very very illegal drugs
01:34:00.239 manufactured by others trafficking
01:34:02.000 people selling people kidnapping and
01:34:04.000 trafficking people and of course
01:34:05.920 trafficking people to conduct slave
01:34:09.239 labor in the 1980s and '90s it even
01:34:12.480 engaged in forging dollar bills and did
01:34:14.960 that so well that American intelligence
01:34:16.960 agencies called those super dollars
01:34:19.360 because their quality was actually
01:34:20.960 better than that of real dollars
01:34:22.960 manufactured in the United States but
01:34:26.000 then by the 2000s this kind of activity
01:34:28.880 began to die down it still happened and
01:34:32.239 even today an occasional North Korean
01:34:34.320 illegal arm sale still gets busted here
01:34:36.320 and there but these days the communist
01:34:39.360 criminal empire is just a shadow of its
01:34:41.360 former self or so it would seem because
01:34:44.400 on some level it's actually bigger than
01:34:47.480 ever the only difference is that the
01:34:49.840 things North Koreans traffic no longer
01:34:52.080 look like
01:34:53.080 this this or this
01:34:57.040 quite often those things took a shape a
01:34:59.760 tad more
01:35:00.920 complicated but printing fake money is
01:35:03.440 one thing hacking an extremely
01:35:05.760 stupendously complicated crypto system
01:35:08.239 is just something
01:35:09.719 else so how did that
01:35:16.120 happen to answer this question we have
01:35:18.800 to learn two Korean words i promise
01:35:21.199 they're easy and unlike some we won't go
01:35:23.360 after you if you don't practice them
01:35:24.719 every day
01:35:26.159 one of those words is ju it's the state
01:35:29.280 ideology of North Korea and the idea
01:35:31.520 that a truly independent country should
01:35:33.600 be completely self-reliant it has to
01:35:35.840 provide everything it needs
01:35:37.800 itself international trade networks
01:35:40.239 complex agreements and supply chains
01:35:42.560 those are evil and have to be eradicated
01:35:44.960 well maybe a country can trade with a
01:35:46.880 small circle of close socialist allies a
01:35:49.440 bit but it certainly can't have anything
01:35:51.600 to do with those evil capitalists and
01:35:54.000 their dangerous
01:35:55.400 ideas think about ju what you will but
01:35:58.239 practice shows that it is uh not very
01:36:01.040 compatible with decent living standards
01:36:03.199 the North Korean middle class lives in
01:36:04.960 what would be considered abject poverty
01:36:06.719 in the rest of the world things like
01:36:08.560 running water and personal
01:36:09.840 transportation are an unreachable luxury
01:36:12.480 food shortages are a daily occurrence
01:36:14.560 and hard manual labor is the primary
01:36:16.960 pastime for people of all ages the
01:36:19.679 internet well it exists in theory or
01:36:22.800 rather in propaganda where North Korean
01:36:25.520 students sit by the computers doing
01:36:28.360 something we saw one guy looking at the
01:36:30.880 Google homepage but he wasn't searching
01:36:33.199 for anything he was just staring blankly
01:36:35.600 at the screen for most North Koreans
01:36:38.080 electricity is the only sign that the
01:36:40.000 industrial revolution actually happened
01:36:42.400 although even that is strictly rationed
01:36:44.719 the grid doesn't work for most of the
01:36:46.320 day and when it does it serves to power
01:36:48.480 radios that blast propaganda that can't
01:36:50.639 be turned off by some estimates the size
01:36:53.760 of the North Korean economy is
01:36:55.280 comparable to that of Afghanistan a
01:36:57.360 country ravaged by decades of war oh and
01:37:00.480 there's one other thing the poverty in
01:37:02.159 North Korean citizens is not even the
01:37:04.080 biggest problem Guushe creates for Kim
01:37:06.520 here you see adhering to this ideology
01:37:09.679 is a bit like living on a remote farm
01:37:11.760 and refusing to interact with the
01:37:13.280 outside world on the surface everything
01:37:15.679 might look okay you control your own
01:37:17.520 life and maintain your own shelter if
01:37:19.600 you're lucky enough you have a surplus
01:37:21.280 of food to sustain yourself but if you
01:37:23.440 grow bored of the same old meals and
01:37:25.520 decide you want to taste something more
01:37:27.119 exotic you're suddenly out of luck
01:37:29.679 you're even more out of luck if you just
01:37:31.360 had a poor harvest and if your farm
01:37:33.360 workers catch a nasty disease or even
01:37:35.520 worse decide to rise up and overthrow
01:37:37.600 you the trouble becomes very very acute
01:37:41.360 you can't get high-tech weapons to
01:37:43.119 protect yourself from adversaries you
01:37:44.880 can't enjoy the newest technological
01:37:46.400 advances made elsewhere in the world and
01:37:48.880 you don't get to destroy your health
01:37:50.480 with those corrupt capitalist snacks
01:37:52.560 they make on the other side of the ocean
01:37:54.560 the North Korean government understands
01:37:56.159 that very well this is why while it
01:37:58.400 touts juouche as the best thing since
01:38:00.400 Kim Osung's invention of sliced bread in
01:38:03.199 reality it's totally fine with this
01:38:05.440 isolationist approach one of those
01:38:08.159 liberties is dabbling in international
01:38:10.360 crime another liberty is songbun the
01:38:13.520 second North Korean word we have to
01:38:15.239 learn you know how in communist
01:38:17.280 countries all the people have to be
01:38:18.719 equal but then some are more equal than
01:38:21.040 others well in North Korea this
01:38:22.880 principle is basically the unspoken law
01:38:25.840 songbun is a rigid semi-official class
01:38:28.239 system the North Korean society lives by
01:38:30.639 it divides all citizens into three
01:38:32.800 categories although each of those
01:38:34.719 categories can be divided further at the
01:38:37.520 very bottom of this system is the
01:38:39.119 hostile class and according to the
01:38:40.960 government the hostiles don't even
01:38:42.719 deserve to know the name of Kim Osung
01:38:44.960 let alone employ any technology beyond
01:38:47.119 their own two hands the wavering or the
01:38:50.159 middle class is the one we've already
01:38:51.840 talked about manual labor radios you
01:38:54.400 can't turn off and life in poverty and
01:38:57.199 then there's the core or the upper class
01:38:59.600 where life looks very different the core
01:39:02.800 is a class that the North Korean
01:39:04.159 government relies on well the entire
01:39:06.560 government belongs to that class so it's
01:39:08.560 a given the army brass the top managers
01:39:11.440 and all the other important North
01:39:12.639 Koreans are members of the core this
01:39:15.600 class has access to a lot of goods one
01:39:17.920 might expect while living in a
01:39:19.119 run-of-the-mill country not a very rich
01:39:21.199 one but not a very poor one
01:39:24.199 either for example this is a North
01:39:26.880 Korean computer shop it has TVs washing
01:39:29.600 machines coffee makers and yes computers
01:39:32.639 not very new ones mind you most of these
01:39:34.639 things are smuggled through an
01:39:35.679 international blockade and the prices
01:39:37.520 are far beyond the reach of most North
01:39:39.360 Koreans also all of them will most
01:39:41.679 likely have the Red Star installed a
01:39:43.920 proprietary North Korean operating
01:39:45.600 system that looks like old Windows or
01:39:47.440 Mac OS tracks everything the user does
01:39:49.840 and only allows connecting to the North
01:39:51.600 Korean version of the internet a
01:39:53.679 completely enclosed network that bears
01:39:55.520 little resemblance to the actual
01:39:57.199 internet but all of that is for the
01:39:59.440 regular members of the core and what if
01:40:02.320 you want the best stuff like Kim himself
01:40:04.960 who always poses with the latest Mac
01:40:08.080 well then you have to climb the ladder
01:40:09.440 even higher because the core class has
01:40:11.360 its own core the elite of the elite the
01:40:14.080 1% of the 1% and North Koreans that
01:40:17.119 belong to that class live in
01:40:19.480 luxury restrictions shortages borders
01:40:22.880 those are things for common folk food
01:40:25.280 technology even media the very top of
01:40:27.840 Song has it all international sanctions
01:40:30.239 be damned in many cases they even get to
01:40:33.520 travel the world on forged passports
01:40:35.679 more often than not and they are the
01:40:37.360 ones Kim relies on when he needs to
01:40:39.119 exchange some of his criminal money for
01:40:40.800 goods tech or whatever else can be found
01:40:42.800 on the black market uranium enrichment
01:40:45.119 centrifuges for example all right that's
01:40:47.360 the end of our lesson about North Korean
01:40:48.880 language and culture just remember
01:40:50.719 there's ju ideology and song bun social
01:40:54.000 systems and those things aren't really
01:40:56.400 compatible with each other because while
01:40:58.400 lowerass have to be content with
01:41:00.119 self-reliance the upper class needs
01:41:02.320 their Macs snacks and nukes and hacking
01:41:06.639 well it sits at the very center of this
01:41:08.639 conundrum it's one of the main ways the
01:41:10.880 North Korean government maintains
01:41:12.320 songbun and circumvents
01:41:14.520 ju and the way how it does that is quite
01:41:17.520 interesting but before explaining it I
01:41:19.840 have to ask you for two things first
01:41:21.920 could you please like this video and
01:41:23.440 subscribe to our channel for the uh
01:41:25.600 greater cause and second uh oh he left
01:41:29.760 well never mind let's go back to the
01:41:31.520 video
01:41:36.239 have you ever seen North Korean children
01:41:38.080 playing musical
01:41:39.320 instruments like this and this and this
01:41:44.080 on the one hand well yeah it's a bit
01:41:46.080 creepy on the other hand these children
01:41:48.159 are well geniuses they have mastered
01:41:50.880 their art to the level very few adults
01:41:53.119 in the rest of the world will ever
01:41:55.159 achieve
01:41:56.920 how well North Korea loves gifted
01:42:01.040 children this is how it manages to have
01:42:03.119 a truly incredible music scene punch way
01:42:05.600 above its economic weight in sports and
01:42:07.760 perform pretty well in other kinds of
01:42:09.440 international
01:42:10.840 competitions children from the middle
01:42:12.719 class and perhaps sometimes even the
01:42:14.880 hostile class are closely monitored if
01:42:17.199 they display talent in music sports or
01:42:19.520 any kind of science they're selected and
01:42:21.600 given rigorous training they can't
01:42:23.520 choose their own career but to be fair
01:42:25.679 their less talented friends don't have
01:42:27.440 this option either what these children
01:42:29.360 can have though is an opportunity to
01:42:32.199 rise they get the best education their
01:42:34.880 country can offer and strict punishment
01:42:37.119 for every failure they can briefly go
01:42:39.360 abroad to various competitions and in
01:42:41.440 the event they succeed their social
01:42:43.280 standing improves and this is not just
01:42:46.320 computer science doesn't matter whether
01:42:48.880 it's sports whether it's uh science
01:42:52.400 whether it's languages whatever uh skill
01:42:55.760 there is whatever North Korea thinks
01:42:58.239 will help serve the state's purposes if
01:43:02.320 they find someone at an early age who
01:43:04.239 has some degree of talent in that then
01:43:06.880 they will get a chance to advance they
01:43:08.960 will be brought in given extra training
01:43:10.719 given extra resources but in the case of
01:43:12.960 math geniuses there's one particular
01:43:15.360 career path that they can get earning
01:43:17.600 money abroad north Korea has been doing
01:43:20.000 that for decades with the plethora of
01:43:21.920 criminal ventures we discussed and one
01:43:24.800 of those ventures as you may remember
01:43:26.639 was slave labor north Koreans would be
01:43:28.960 sent off to do everything from laying
01:43:30.480 bricks in the Middle East to cutting
01:43:32.080 wood in Siberia but if they can do that
01:43:34.960 maybe they could get some higherp paying
01:43:37.639 jobs this realization struck North Korea
01:43:40.639 in the
01:43:41.639 2000s everything digital was you know
01:43:44.400 like the bomb jobs in the IT sector
01:43:46.960 became some of the most prestigious and
01:43:48.800 could net serious profit spend a few
01:43:51.199 years learning programming or web design
01:43:53.040 and you'd find yourself earning more
01:43:54.480 money than an entire team of
01:43:56.679 lumberjacks of course building an IT
01:43:59.280 industry even a small one inside North
01:44:01.760 Korea was impossible north Korea's
01:44:04.080 internet connections are closely
01:44:05.440 monitored and any detected breach of
01:44:07.440 international sanctions would risk grave
01:44:10.280 consequences but that's where the idea
01:44:12.239 of sending laborers abroad comes in
01:44:14.239 again get some math geniuses forged
01:44:16.400 passports fly them to a country with
01:44:18.320 badly supervised borders and there you
01:44:20.480 go an army of expat IT workers we know
01:44:24.159 of at least several cases where this
01:44:25.760 model was applied and entire
01:44:27.360 establishments to support them were
01:44:29.560 created one of those establishments
01:44:31.840 looked like this a budget hotel in
01:44:34.000 Shenyang China it operated as an actual
01:44:36.639 real hotel with surprisingly good
01:44:38.719 amenities for real guests but most of
01:44:40.719 its guests weren't well customers they
01:44:43.679 were North Koreans who worked there
01:44:45.600 using local internet access we spoke to
01:44:48.159 someone who who who'd actually stayed
01:44:49.920 there um an individual US individual who
01:44:53.119 had it booked as his sort of corporate
01:44:54.880 you know accommodation for his trip to
01:44:56.560 China and when he walked in he found a
01:44:58.800 whole bunch of North Koreans and the TVs
01:45:00.960 on the wall were showing sort of footage
01:45:02.880 of the the war in North Korea uh the war
01:45:05.440 in Korea I should say but but done from
01:45:07.280 the North Korean side as though the
01:45:08.800 Koreans won that war um very very
01:45:11.440 peculiar with time the establishment
01:45:14.239 came to be known as Hacker Hotel because
01:45:16.800 sure sending well-educated workers to
01:45:18.800 earn money by doing remote office work
01:45:20.639 is a good enough way to make some cash
01:45:22.560 but if you don't have qualms about
01:45:23.760 abiding by the law there are some ways
01:45:25.600 to earn vastly more money very very
01:45:28.760 quickly it didn't start like that though
01:45:31.440 early North Korean hacking operations
01:45:33.199 were all about prestige and a bit about
01:45:35.199 espionage in the mid-200s they began
01:45:37.760 carefully attacking South Korea mostly
01:45:39.840 jamming its services with distributed
01:45:41.679 denial of service attacks those didn't
01:45:44.080 do long-lasting damage but proved to be
01:45:46.000 quite an annoyance by the mid2010s these
01:45:49.360 hackers went fully international and
01:45:51.600 this time they meant business in 2014
01:45:54.400 they hacked Sony as revenge for the
01:45:56.639 release of a film that makes fun of Kim
01:45:58.400 Jong-un and executed a data heist that
01:46:01.040 showed excellent understanding of both
01:46:02.719 technical and social aspects of hacking
01:46:05.760 but those aspects help them immensely
01:46:07.600 with the task most countries use their
01:46:09.520 hacking armies for espionage they've
01:46:12.239 been known to target defense companies
01:46:14.000 both in countries that they don't get
01:46:16.080 along with and also sometimes in
01:46:19.520 friendly countries like Russia uh they
01:46:21.920 last year they seemingly tried to steal
01:46:24.560 missile data from uh Russian missile
01:46:27.800 manufacturer that sort of information is
01:46:30.080 very important for their weapons
01:46:31.360 development and beyond that they will
01:46:33.760 also target researchers they will target
01:46:36.400 uh strategy they will target government
01:46:38.159 organizations around the world because
01:46:40.480 they want to understand policy decisions
01:46:43.199 but the same techniques work against
01:46:44.880 commercial entities as well so why not
01:46:47.040 commercialize it in the late 2010s North
01:46:49.760 Koreans went all in on that hacking
01:46:51.840 banks distributing ransomware performing
01:46:54.159 these massive operations only a state
01:46:56.560 sponsored hacker army could pull off a
01:46:59.119 few years passed and crypto became a
01:47:01.280 thing an entire monetary system designed
01:47:04.000 to circumvent the controls of
01:47:05.440 governments and institutions who could
01:47:07.440 have guessed that it would become
01:47:08.719 popular with criminals and who could
01:47:10.880 have guessed that somebody like North
01:47:12.560 Korea could jump in on exploiting it
01:47:14.639 with such enthusiasm the twist as you
01:47:17.679 might have guessed is that North Korea
01:47:19.440 went a step beyond just using crypto
01:47:22.400 robbing other crypto users blind was
01:47:24.800 also on the menu for several years in a
01:47:27.440 row now it's estimated that around half
01:47:29.440 of cryptocurrency thefts in the world
01:47:31.440 are the work of North Korean hacking
01:47:33.040 groups the Axi Infinity hack was the
01:47:35.600 largest and the most prominent of them
01:47:37.679 but countless smaller ones happen almost
01:47:39.840 every month and by the way North Korea
01:47:42.600 denies that hack and all of the other
01:47:45.440 hacks attributed to it north Korea says
01:47:47.360 this is a smear campaign by its enemies
01:47:49.280 including uh the US are we certain these
01:47:52.560 attacks were done by North Koreans let's
01:47:54.800 be clear cyber crime attribution is a
01:47:57.199 tricky business digital footprints are
01:47:59.440 exactly that they're digital they can be
01:48:01.520 manipulated misplaced forged and simply
01:48:04.760 erased but in every one of those cases
01:48:07.360 and in thousands more there is more than
01:48:09.679 enough evidence to suggest that the
01:48:11.280 attacks were performed by North Korean
01:48:12.960 hacking groups that operate outside the
01:48:14.880 country under some false identities and
01:48:17.119 shell companies mr creator is using your
01:48:19.679 Upwork or LinkedIn account to scam
01:48:21.679 people you get 10% of these fraudulent
01:48:24.320 earnings if he actually does pay you but
01:48:26.560 all of the scam is under your LinkedIn
01:48:29.440 account which is under your name or your
01:48:31.679 Upwork account which is under your name
01:48:33.760 because to sign up for these services
01:48:35.199 you need to have ID verification there's
01:48:37.679 been research by the United Nations and
01:48:40.000 other um watch groups that are working
01:48:43.280 with the global community to to um
01:48:46.159 prevent them from gaining access to
01:48:48.239 weapons and uh a good amount of the
01:48:52.639 money that they've converted into fiat
01:48:54.480 currency has been traced to uh purchases
01:48:57.679 of materials to build their missiles
01:49:00.000 program of course there's still a lot of
01:49:02.159 details we don't know as you might
01:49:04.080 expect the closer you examine the
01:49:06.080 structure of North Korea's hacker army
01:49:08.239 the murkier it gets we know about the
01:49:10.400 payloads they use the hours they operate
01:49:12.800 even the locations of some operations
01:49:15.199 but beyond that lies quite a mystery
01:49:18.360 typically there will operate under the
01:49:21.040 reconnaons general bureau now within
01:49:22.880 that there's a lot of disagreement on
01:49:25.760 how things are structured a particular
01:49:28.560 bureau associated with technologies
01:49:30.960 called the third bureau which is
01:49:33.119 responsible some people say for foreign
01:49:34.800 intelligence some people say it was for
01:49:36.880 technical reconnaissance uh and a lot as
01:49:40.719 a result a lot of uh cyber groups
01:49:43.199 operate under these bureaus and another
01:49:46.239 entity called lab 110 which some view as
01:49:50.239 a reorganization of a previous bureau
01:49:52.639 responsible for cyber crime we don't
01:49:54.320 know how this is and even during the
01:49:56.320 pandemic there have been reports that
01:49:58.239 cyber crime operations have been
01:50:00.840 reorganized uh what we do know for sure
01:50:04.159 is that within these bureaus there
01:50:07.119 operating under them are many different
01:50:10.480 cyber criminals many different thread
01:50:12.600 groups uh and we know them by different
01:50:15.520 names uh Lazarus Kimuki Andario Lunarov
01:50:23.760 so what we know for sure is that the
01:50:25.520 North Korean government collects the
01:50:27.119 most talented and dedicated people among
01:50:29.360 its population trains them invests in
01:50:31.840 them and turns them into talented
01:50:34.119 hackers we know they mostly operate
01:50:36.400 under the pretense of false identities
01:50:38.000 and shell companies outside of the
01:50:39.840 country under the watchful eye of the
01:50:41.760 North Korean military we also know they
01:50:44.320 have a surprising amount of freedom in
01:50:46.080 how they operate a great illustration of
01:50:48.480 that is in the latest invention of these
01:50:50.239 hackers the job by proxy scheme here's
01:50:53.119 how it works north Korean agents contact
01:50:55.920 people from the US or Europe and get
01:50:57.920 them to apply for IT jobs those
01:51:00.080 Americans or Europeans don't really work
01:51:03.040 north Koreans do but the employer has no
01:51:05.600 idea about that worst case scenario the
01:51:08.159 hacker earns a lot of money best case
01:51:10.320 they get exclusive access to the systems
01:51:12.480 of some large companies stealing their
01:51:14.560 secrets
01:51:16.080 this just like a lot of other attacks
01:51:17.840 North Korea performs is not just a job
01:51:20.000 that requires technical skill what it
01:51:22.239 requires is exquisite mastery of social
01:51:25.000 engineering convincing fishing messages
01:51:27.520 scam calls fake websites the vast
01:51:30.000 majority of hacks begin this way that's
01:51:32.880 not to say they lack technical skill
01:51:34.960 quite the opposite and on top of it all
01:51:37.280 they're extremely extremely good at
01:51:40.480 innovating
01:51:42.159 they're extremely sophisticated and they
01:51:45.040 stay ahead of the changing crypto
01:51:47.639 technology more than most in the crypto
01:51:51.199 enthusiast world they are often you know
01:51:54.800 one step ahead or alongside you know the
01:51:57.520 best and brightest in the crypto
01:51:58.960 investigative world and they're
01:52:01.599 continuously experimenting with new ways
01:52:03.920 to either steal money or make money off
01:52:06.800 of crypto schemes or launder funds we've
01:52:10.159 seen them dappling in mining we've seen
01:52:12.560 them dappling in NFTTS we've seen them
01:52:14.880 dappling in Monero as you mentioned in
01:52:17.840 in bits of um ways that they can move
01:52:23.000 money or gain access to to money out of
01:52:27.440 crypto there is one more problem though
01:52:30.960 those hackers have to get a taste of the
01:52:33.119 outside world they even have to learn
01:52:35.040 how it works after all they will be the
01:52:37.199 ones doing everything from scam calls to
01:52:39.520 leveraging the subtleties of the crypto
01:52:41.560 market and after they learn about the
01:52:43.760 outside world even train in the western
01:52:45.760 way of life they might get a bit
01:52:47.760 difficult to
01:52:48.760 control this is where the class system
01:52:51.199 comes in again for one those hackers
01:52:54.320 aren't too different from the regular
01:52:55.840 elite who travel the world enjoy the
01:52:58.080 internet and eat all of the potato chips
01:53:00.159 they want in fact the math geniuses
01:53:03.199 might even come from the elite class or
01:53:05.360 get motivated with the prospect of
01:53:06.960 joining it if the money-grabbing
01:53:08.560 adventure ends up being successful
01:53:10.520 enough so the North Korean hacking
01:53:13.040 business is a nasty feedback loop it
01:53:15.280 props up the social hierarchy helps the
01:53:17.360 country to sustain its elite class but
01:53:19.599 that elite class also makes the whole
01:53:21.840 hacking endeavor possible and what if
01:53:24.639 the whole social coercion scheme fails
01:53:27.119 what if the thought of defecting still
01:53:29.040 crosses the hacker's mind
01:53:31.280 there are the usual sticks total
01:53:33.280 surveillance a threat of execution and
01:53:35.520 the prospect of demoting the entire
01:53:37.280 family of the misbehaving hacker to the
01:53:39.119 undesirable class and of course there's
01:53:41.840 the greatest deterrent of them all
01:53:44.920 apathy one of the interesting things
01:53:46.880 that I saw a description of inside North
01:53:49.360 Korea was a bunch of university students
01:53:51.440 who were looking at the internet the
01:53:53.119 open internet and they were told to go
01:53:54.960 away and research and find out I don't
01:53:57.280 know the height of the Empire State
01:53:58.719 Building or something like that so they
01:54:00.159 can see New York they can see the Empire
01:54:01.760 State Building they can see Manhattan
01:54:03.920 but beyond that they had no
01:54:05.639 inquisitiveness they didn't want to know
01:54:07.679 well what is New York like and where is
01:54:09.599 the Empire State Building and what is
01:54:11.280 Central Park and how these people live
01:54:13.040 there was no inquisitiveness they they
01:54:14.800 simply saw the internet as a window into
01:54:16.400 a world they would never visit so that
01:54:18.320 idea of of inquisitiveness about the
01:54:20.320 outside world is stamped down on from
01:54:23.199 birth in North Korea and it's possible
01:54:25.760 that there's something else North Korea
01:54:27.520 stamps out do you remember the first
01:54:30.159 time you heard of North Korean hackers
01:54:32.400 what was your reaction weren't you
01:54:34.320 convinced that it's impossible that
01:54:36.000 North Korea can't have anything to do
01:54:37.679 with hacking a country where most of the
01:54:40.400 population lives in poverty and
01:54:41.840 exclusion running one of the most
01:54:43.599 sophisticated wellorganized and
01:54:45.679 impactful hacking operations in the
01:54:47.920 whole world this idea sounds absurd two
01:54:51.280 stories that don't mesh with each other
01:54:52.800 very well and yet when you dig deeper
01:54:55.440 they don't only coexist they complent
01:54:57.920 each other
01:54:59.280 but making that idea sound absurd
01:55:01.679 stamping out any inquisitiveness about
01:55:03.679 the criminal empire of the North Korean
01:55:05.599 regime that's quite a strategy
01:55:08.239 convincing the rest of the world that
01:55:09.920 you don't pose any danger and you're
01:55:12.000 just a hermit kingdom full of poverty
01:55:13.840 naive propaganda a slightly mad leader
01:55:16.400 and his weird obsession with nukes that
01:55:18.480 don't even work most of the time sounds
01:55:21.360 quite
01:55:22.280 ingenious to be fair we don't know if
01:55:25.040 this is on purpose or just a happy
01:55:27.040 coincidence the North Korean regime
01:55:28.719 loves to exploit but we sincerely hope
01:55:31.840 that after watching this video you won't
01:55:33.920 fall for it because you've learned
01:55:35.920 something new about the
01:55:47.480 world how do you hack something oh we
01:55:50.719 all know the answer you sit by the
01:55:52.560 computer and bash the keyboard
01:55:55.760 some numbers and symbols fly across the
01:55:57.679 screen if the bashing is intensive
01:55:59.599 enough success you're in it works on the
01:56:02.960 movies and TV shows it should work the
01:56:05.440 same in real
01:56:09.800 life it doesn't no matter how hard you
01:56:13.440 try no matter how many keyboards you
01:56:15.760 break you are not going to break good
01:56:17.920 cyber security for that you need
01:56:21.199 something special a secret
01:56:24.880 and to get that secret you have to
01:56:27.119 become part of the deepest and darkest
01:56:29.440 community on the
01:56:31.000 internet forget your dark web market
01:56:33.599 places and hacker forums it's deeper
01:56:36.000 than that it's a space whose entire
01:56:39.119 existence rests on its covertness where
01:56:42.080 the world's best hackers trade secrets
01:56:44.239 for lifechanging sums of money where
01:56:46.800 governments mega corporations and
01:56:49.119 criminal cartels compete over snippets
01:56:51.440 of information that can change the world
01:56:54.560 welcome to the zeroday
01:56:59.590 [Music]
01:57:08.040 market you're standing in front of a
01:57:10.320 high and strong
01:57:12.520 wall how do you get to the other side
01:57:16.239 walls like this are all over the
01:57:18.000 internet they guard the data of
01:57:19.760 companies nations institutions even
01:57:22.480 people like you when somebody purchases
01:57:25.199 a gadget or an app the wall is included
01:57:27.920 in the price people are paying for not
01:57:30.639 getting
01:57:31.480 hacked but how do you hack things then
01:57:35.520 how do you get to the other side of that
01:57:37.639 wall smaller walls can be scaled or
01:57:40.719 broken through that's what things like
01:57:42.880 SQL injections and DOS do
01:57:46.560 most walls have an even easier access
01:57:49.040 just talking your way in that's called
01:57:51.280 social
01:57:52.199 engineering but for some even the
01:57:54.639 strongest brute force or the cleverest
01:57:56.960 infiltration is not going to work you
01:57:59.599 need a better way in you come closer and
01:58:02.880 inspect the bricks maybe one of them is
01:58:05.679 cracked or protrudes just enough to give
01:58:08.400 you a foothold maybe it can be moved to
01:58:10.880 reveal a secret
01:58:12.280 passage windows 10 and Mac OS X some of
01:58:15.599 the most popular operational systems out
01:58:17.599 there have around 80 million lines of
01:58:19.840 code if each line was a brick you could
01:58:22.560 build nearly 300 miles of wall with them
01:58:26.159 300 m 80 million bricks what's the
01:58:30.480 chance that one of them has a flaw in
01:58:33.520 the code a flawed brick is a bug a
01:58:36.239 vulnerability that can be used and
01:58:37.920 exploited a hole in the system you can
01:58:40.480 slip through the companies that build
01:58:42.960 walls don't want flawed bricks the
01:58:45.599 income of those companies depend on
01:58:47.199 shipping a secure product they have
01:58:49.280 entire departments dedicated to finding
01:58:51.280 flaws in the code and pay hefty sums of
01:58:53.760 money to anyone who can reveal a bug and
01:58:56.080 whenever a company finds a vulnerability
01:58:57.840 in its software it issues a patch a fix
01:59:00.639 that replaces the brick and removes the
01:59:03.800 vulnerability so the importance of a
01:59:06.000 security flaw is measured by how long
01:59:08.159 ago it was discovered weak old bugs are
01:59:11.040 as good as patched two or three days old
01:59:13.679 ones are probably being exploited by
01:59:16.080 every wannabe hacker out there and the
01:59:18.159 patch is already on the
01:59:20.119 way but if a company has no idea a bug
01:59:23.199 exists in other words if it had known
01:59:25.760 about a bug for 0 days it's a whole
01:59:29.040 other story a useful zero day is the
01:59:32.639 holy grail of hacking a secret
01:59:34.719 vulnerability that can be exploited to
01:59:36.639 breach the security of a device or an
01:59:39.040 app or an entire network not only are
01:59:42.080 you slipping right through the wall
01:59:44.239 nobody even suspects you're doing it but
01:59:48.080 good zero days are hard to come by to
01:59:50.560 find one you have to be better at
01:59:52.239 spotting flaws than every single
01:59:54.239 engineer hired by the wall building
01:59:56.000 company and even then you may spend
01:59:58.480 years staring at the code and looking
02:00:00.719 for a useful flaw or you can look for
02:00:03.440 someone who already did
02:00:05.480 that this is Bug Track a mailing list
02:00:08.719 that dates back to the early '90s and
02:00:11.040 the place you can find thousands of what
02:00:13.040 used to be zero days for a long time
02:00:16.960 hackers really had very little interest
02:00:18.960 in money and in the beginning when they
02:00:20.880 would find zero day exploits and when I
02:00:22.480 say the beginning I'm talking about um
02:00:24.719 mainly the '9s they would go to the
02:00:27.840 companies that had written this sloppy
02:00:29.960 software like HP Oracle Microsoft Sun
02:00:35.560 Microsystems and they would say hey I
02:00:37.840 found this bug in your software it's a
02:00:39.679 zero day by the way this is Nicole
02:00:41.679 Pearllarth she's a New York Times
02:00:43.440 journalist who spent years investigating
02:00:45.199 the zeroday marketplace and a lot of
02:00:47.440 what we know about its history comes
02:00:48.960 from her reporting to create this story
02:00:51.599 we reached out to experts like her who
02:00:53.520 have actual hands-on experience finding
02:00:55.920 and contacting them is a bit more
02:00:57.760 difficult than it looks the only reason
02:00:59.920 we can do this is you our viewers and we
02:01:02.960 are thankful for every token of
02:01:04.560 appreciation you can give be it a like a
02:01:07.440 subscribe or a comment a small gesture
02:01:10.080 can go a long way
02:01:12.239 so the early hackers would attempt to
02:01:14.400 contact the companies and notify them
02:01:16.239 about zero days in their software and
02:01:19.040 the companies instead of looking at this
02:01:21.119 as oh thank you for the free quality
02:01:23.440 assurance uh often replied with a letter
02:01:27.280 from their general counsel saying if you
02:01:29.040 poke around our software again we'll see
02:01:31.599 to it that you go to prison so bug track
02:01:35.599 you create a snappy handle you hide
02:01:37.520 behind a proxy you take your zero day
02:01:40.000 and mail it to thousands of hackers
02:01:41.760 across the world the community gets
02:01:43.840 valuable information the company gets
02:01:45.840 punished and you get street
02:01:47.880 credit sharing and exploring zero days
02:01:50.639 was a major part of the early hacker
02:01:52.480 culture and a source of pride for many
02:01:55.280 but as the years went by this state of
02:01:57.599 things began changing into something
02:02:00.599 unrecognizable there is a wall and you
02:02:03.440 really really need to get to the other
02:02:05.440 side you have money you have connections
02:02:08.560 you have resources all you need is a
02:02:11.880 hint you go to bug track and look for
02:02:14.560 names there is pneumonics ALF1 hacknisti
02:02:19.119 scores upon scores of handles a lot of
02:02:21.760 very skilled people who do a lot of work
02:02:23.679 for free but maybe some of them would
02:02:26.400 like a bit of compensation
02:02:28.800 you choose one an email a polite
02:02:31.920 well-measured offer and a sum more than
02:02:35.599 they earn in a year more than the
02:02:37.840 software company is willing to pay for
02:02:39.679 the same bug there are very few problems
02:02:43.119 a bottomless budget can't solve years
02:02:46.560 pass you do the same again and again you
02:02:50.239 establish stronger connections
02:02:52.360 relationships networks some of the
02:02:55.040 people are reliable others not so much
02:02:58.400 you keep the reliable ones close the
02:03:00.880 dangerous ones even closer you are not
02:03:04.000 the only one buying and your contacts
02:03:06.239 are not the only ones selling a market
02:03:08.719 begins to form and grow just by sending
02:03:11.360 some emails you get zero days that can
02:03:13.599 bypass any wall and even if you have a
02:03:16.960 problem finding sellers there might be a
02:03:19.360 solution to that middlemen emerge
02:03:22.480 zeroday brokers companies with shady
02:03:25.360 names and even shadier backgrounds
02:03:27.360 willing to help you in your struggle
02:03:29.280 they can find whoever you need and
02:03:31.119 conduct the transaction they will even
02:03:33.280 confirm if the merchandise works and
02:03:35.280 vouch for its
02:03:36.520 effectiveness they're very much a
02:03:38.320 matchmaking service right government
02:03:40.480 right could go and and you know post
02:03:42.719 even you know anonymously on on Reddit
02:03:44.880 or you know some underground forum hey I
02:03:46.880 want to go buy an exploit right but but
02:03:49.040 then you're dealing with some unknown um
02:03:51.119 some unknown party you have issues
02:03:52.880 around escrow right you know both trust
02:03:55.440 from the buyer side and trust from the
02:03:57.599 seller side and so these exploit brokers
02:04:00.960 work as middlemen and
02:04:02.679 matchmakers they're holding stuff in
02:04:04.639 escrow and then they're confirming the
02:04:06.080 vulnerability or holding funds in escrow
02:04:08.000 and then confirming the vulnerability
02:04:09.520 actually works in many cases before even
02:04:12.239 brokering uh brokering the deal and then
02:04:14.320 of course for all those services they
02:04:15.920 take a percentage off the top so you buy
02:04:18.320 a snippet of information from a broker
02:04:20.159 or an anonymous hacker online you
02:04:22.719 confirm that the vulnerability works and
02:04:25.040 you develop an exploit a piece of
02:04:26.960 malware that can reliably turn one
02:04:29.199 flawed piece of code into a safe passage
02:04:32.159 through the wall time to use
02:04:35.880 it what you are looking at now is an
02:04:38.480 exploit not an actual one but a
02:04:41.119 reconstruction a researcher managed to
02:04:43.199 piece together after scraping the
02:04:44.880 remains of an attack on his phone it's
02:04:48.080 designed to infect iPhones through an
02:04:49.920 invisible iMessage the user never gets a
02:04:52.920 notification not even a blip on the
02:04:54.960 screen a snippet of code just slips in
02:04:57.679 and stays completely silent it begins
02:05:01.040 working through a particular bug a flaw
02:05:03.520 that existed in Apple's software for
02:05:05.440 decades a remnant of a function that has
02:05:07.840 long been discontinued a deformed brick
02:05:10.880 that once supported a wall but no longer
02:05:13.719 does after slipping through the code
02:05:16.320 takes over a small part of the phone's
02:05:18.159 memory just enough to get some minor
02:05:20.480 things done using this memory the
02:05:23.440 message finds another larger hole in the
02:05:26.000 wall another zero day through which an
02:05:28.560 even more malicious code can be brought
02:05:30.400 through it's unexploitable from outside
02:05:33.280 but once you're in you can use it the
02:05:36.560 new code is more potent and it begins a
02:05:39.040 war on the phone's native systems a
02:05:41.520 short battle rages under the fingers of
02:05:43.520 the unsuspecting user until the invading
02:05:46.000 code uses yet another vulnerability one
02:05:48.960 that allows it to bypass all defenses in
02:05:52.400 several seconds the iPhone is
02:05:55.000 conquered finally one more vulnerability
02:05:58.000 is used to gain access and take over the
02:06:00.400 Safari browser now the phone is at the
02:06:03.119 mercy of the intruder and will report
02:06:05.280 everything the owner does sees or hears
02:06:08.400 a string of four zero days an entire
02:06:11.119 attack chain tied together by some very
02:06:13.199 well-written code giving you
02:06:14.880 unrestricted access to any iPhone on the
02:06:17.520 planet the researchers called this chain
02:06:20.080 operation triangulation a weird name for
02:06:23.199 an attack that has four prongs not three
02:06:26.080 but who are we to judge weird naming
02:06:28.719 aside these exploits are incredibly
02:06:30.880 potent and incredibly dangerous and to
02:06:33.599 get that sort of capability you have to
02:06:36.159 pay the price
02:06:38.960 just like with almost anything on an
02:06:40.719 open market the price is a reflection of
02:06:43.040 the
02:06:43.800 usefulness one of the very few glimpses
02:06:46.400 we get into the cost of attacks like
02:06:48.159 Operation Triangulation is a list by
02:06:50.320 Zerodium a major broker company that
02:06:52.960 actually publishes its
02:06:54.760 prices according to Zerodium a zero day
02:06:58.000 that allows you to bypass a phone's
02:06:59.679 passcode or a PIN nowadays is up to
02:07:02.599 $100,000 a zero day that allows you to
02:07:05.440 access their chat application a web
02:07:07.440 browser or an email could cost up to a
02:07:09.920 half a million zero days that give you
02:07:12.719 access to somebody's phone without any
02:07:14.800 interaction on their part can net two
02:07:17.400 to$2.5
02:07:19.480 million so millions of dollars to break
02:07:22.719 into a phone and that's not even
02:07:24.800 counting the salaries of the small army
02:07:26.880 of hackers who wrote the exploit making
02:07:29.280 the zero day usable these are not the
02:07:32.159 amounts of money you pay to keep tabs on
02:07:33.840 your cheating fiance the people who use
02:07:36.079 these attacks aim a lot higher the
02:07:39.119 biggest demographic of buyers um you
02:07:41.440 know on open markets is is probably
02:07:43.520 governments i mean I I you know they
02:07:45.520 they have they have money that cyber
02:07:47.679 criminals you know can't touch um you
02:07:49.840 know or can't possibly you know can't
02:07:51.520 possibly amass even some of these larger
02:07:53.119 ransomware gangs and the value right
02:07:55.199 that they get out of the um you know out
02:07:57.119 of the intelligence that they gain with
02:07:59.119 these zero days is not measured in
02:08:01.119 dollars and cents either some zero days
02:08:03.520 are harmless you know you find a mistake
02:08:05.760 in the code and it might be in a system
02:08:09.440 which is not widely used or if it's even
02:08:12.079 used by some niche audience it's not uh
02:08:15.199 that interesting not worth your effort
02:08:17.599 to break into that system but the
02:08:19.920 systems that hackers in nation states
02:08:22.560 spend a lot of time on right now are
02:08:25.920 iPhone software Android
02:08:28.360 software software that touches critical
02:08:31.320 infrastructure software that touches um
02:08:34.880 like I said you know cryptocurrency
02:08:37.040 systems uh wallets that could get you a
02:08:39.840 lot of cash uh in cryptocurrency we may
02:08:42.880 never know the actual cost of operation
02:08:44.960 triangulation there's only a small
02:08:47.040 handful of broker companies that publish
02:08:48.880 their prices and countless more that
02:08:50.960 don't the actual cost of a zero day let
02:08:53.840 alone an exploit can vary a lot a good
02:08:57.280 example of that is Operation Zero a
02:08:59.520 broker that popped up just a few years
02:09:01.280 ago in September 2023 it offered the
02:09:04.400 highest price for an exploit that has
02:09:06.159 ever been recorded $20 million for an
02:09:09.199 attack chain things like Operation
02:09:11.119 Triangulation could cost at least as
02:09:13.360 much or even more all of that to give
02:09:16.400 you access to a phone a small device
02:09:19.040 that tracks its users but some targets
02:09:21.679 of such attacks are bigger another zero
02:09:24.960 day bought for a similar price might net
02:09:27.199 you an entrance to a desktop computer or
02:09:29.520 an industrial controller or an entire
02:09:32.000 network that maintains infrastructure of
02:09:33.840 a factory a military base a city
02:09:40.079 stuckset one of the most advanced
02:09:41.920 examples of malware used a string of
02:09:44.079 four zero days to enter an Iranian
02:09:46.159 nuclear facility and disable
02:09:48.599 it not Peta the most damaging cyber
02:09:51.760 attack ever recorded used one single
02:09:54.320 zero day to paralyze an entire country
02:09:56.639 for several days causing billions of
02:09:58.800 dollars worth of damage to international
02:10:00.560 companies that operated there
02:10:03.840 the phone of Jamal Kashagi a journalist
02:10:06.400 murdered by the Saudi Arabian government
02:10:08.239 in 2018 was monitored and tracked by the
02:10:11.040 government after infecting his devices
02:10:13.119 through zero
02:10:15.480 days so far we've been comparing a zero
02:10:18.239 day to a flaw in a wall a brick that
02:10:20.880 reveals a hidden entrance this
02:10:22.960 comparison is quite harmless maybe a bit
02:10:25.760 too harmless a zero day could also be
02:10:28.960 compared to a weapon or more correctly a
02:10:32.159 material from which a weapon can be made
02:10:34.719 a more powerful weapon than almost
02:10:36.960 anything in the world with the right set
02:10:39.840 of zero days a government can wage cyber
02:10:42.400 war against both competing governments
02:10:44.480 and its own citizens for a government
02:10:46.880 with enough funds to buy such a
02:10:48.719 collection and enough skilled personnel
02:10:50.800 to correctly exploit it any security is
02:10:54.000 no longer an obstacle and most of these
02:10:56.960 zero days have at some point been traded
02:10:59.040 on the zero-day market they were bought
02:11:01.679 sold and shared this happens every day
02:11:05.679 right there under the noses of law
02:11:07.440 enforcement regulators and corporations
02:11:10.159 that can't and won't do anything to
02:11:12.320 fight it why how is trading zero days
02:11:16.079 even legal and why nobody treats it with
02:11:18.719 at least a fraction of the seriousness
02:11:20.800 people treat the sale of weapons of mass
02:11:22.560 destruction
02:11:24.159 well the answer to that is a bit
02:11:28.840 complicated the zero-day market is a
02:11:31.280 sprawling structure with several levels
02:11:33.280 and a huge variety of players it seems
02:11:36.320 harmless on the surface nowadays unlike
02:11:39.199 20 or 30 years ago lots of companies
02:11:41.679 offer bug bounty programs they pay for
02:11:44.239 any vulnerabilities found in their
02:11:45.920 software encouraging hackers to earn
02:11:47.920 their income legally and make the
02:11:49.599 internet more secure in the process
02:11:52.320 some firms and researchers do the same
02:11:54.320 but independently they look for bugs on
02:11:56.560 the code of popular software and notify
02:11:58.719 the vendors sometimes they get paid in
02:12:01.760 any case they get exposure the corporate
02:12:04.400 version of hacker street cred this is
02:12:07.360 how the white market works the tip of
02:12:09.760 the iceberg something most people mean
02:12:12.320 when they talk about zero days but there
02:12:15.440 is a level below that the part of the
02:12:17.599 market where companies don't have catchy
02:12:19.520 names and aren't too fond of being
02:12:21.679 noticed where researchers don't
02:12:24.000 advertise their findings and a lot of
02:12:26.079 them get redacted you you can go search
02:12:29.119 LinkedIn um and find people that are um
02:12:32.480 you know hiring contractors or that are
02:12:34.719 hiring for vulnerability research um you
02:12:37.840 know requiring security clearance that's
02:12:40.480 not an anomaly in the US but make no
02:12:42.880 mistake about it right all all all all
02:12:44.639 governments are are either researching
02:12:46.719 these or purchasing them and probably
02:12:48.960 some combination thereof this is the
02:12:51.840 gray market strictly speaking it's not
02:12:54.400 legal but it's not illegal either the
02:12:57.599 governments are investing in research
02:12:59.119 and hiding what they find from the
02:13:00.639 public they pay the hackers for their
02:13:02.480 silence and use the zero days for spying
02:13:04.800 and cyber warfare it's hard to
02:13:07.119 comprehend morally dubious and entirely
02:13:10.159 unregulated
02:13:12.079 but there's a level below that too
02:13:14.480 finally we have the black market which
02:13:16.480 is sometimes governments if there are
02:13:19.079 international regulations limiting their
02:13:21.920 ability to buy due the exploits on the
02:13:25.040 gray market a lot of illegal activity
02:13:27.199 goes on on black market and the value is
02:13:30.159 much higher than white market could be
02:13:32.079 10 to 100 times as high for exploits as
02:13:34.960 on the white market so you will find a
02:13:37.440 lot of international crime networks and
02:13:40.079 organizations some rogue governments
02:13:42.560 non-state actors of various types
02:13:44.639 operating there illicitly recently the
02:13:47.679 world witnessed a very telling example
02:13:49.520 of exactly that this is an app called
02:13:52.239 Move It a file transfer protocol similar
02:13:54.719 to Wei Transfer or One Drive it has a
02:13:57.280 boring interface and a moderate market
02:13:59.280 share safe to say you've probably never
02:14:02.079 used it unless you worked at a major
02:14:05.040 corporation or government office before
02:14:07.599 2023 most of its clients were the big
02:14:10.159 shots the likes of Shell Sony and the US
02:14:13.280 Department of Energy in June 2023 KOP a
02:14:17.360 major ransomware gang acquired a zeroday
02:14:20.079 vulnerability in Move It software
02:14:22.639 immediately it was used to breach the
02:14:24.320 service and steal the data of all its
02:14:26.639 clients and what resulted was the
02:14:29.520 largest ransomware attack in recent
02:14:31.280 years klopp's list includes over 2 and a
02:14:34.000 half thousand companies and nearly 90
02:14:36.639 million people more than the population
02:14:38.800 of such countries as Germany or France
02:14:41.920 klopp began extorting the companies
02:14:43.840 threatening to release their secrets if
02:14:45.599 they didn't pay ransom we'll never know
02:14:47.760 how many companies budged but the
02:14:49.520 payouts quite certainly made a lot of
02:14:51.599 criminals very very rich all thanks to
02:14:54.880 one single zero day
02:15:00.400 so it started with nation states and
02:15:02.400 their
02:15:03.320 contractors and like most of these
02:15:06.000 techniques and tools it has now migrated
02:15:09.040 to cyber criminals and over the past few
02:15:12.320 years we've seen cyber criminals use
02:15:14.239 zeroday exploits in various ransomware
02:15:16.480 attacks um or hacks of cryptocurrency
02:15:19.760 exchanges or wallets and that kind of
02:15:21.440 thing so that's the black part of the
02:15:24.079 zeroday market with it the whole thing
02:15:26.560 seems quite neat and organized you have
02:15:29.360 the good guys who work openly and hunt
02:15:31.360 for zero days to expose them and make
02:15:33.360 everyone safer you have governments and
02:15:35.760 shady companies who trade zero days to
02:15:38.000 stay on top of the cyber warfare game
02:15:40.239 and you have the criminal organizations
02:15:42.079 that buy zero days to steal data you can
02:15:45.440 read all about this on Wikipedia or well
02:15:48.239 anywhere
02:15:49.840 but this structure is clear only from
02:15:51.679 the surface when you begin looking at
02:15:53.840 the market closer the lines begin to
02:15:56.400 blur and things get
02:16:01.480 worse let's get back to Operation
02:16:03.960 Triangulation an exploit that used four
02:16:06.480 zero days to gain access to any iPhone
02:16:09.920 this operation was discovered after
02:16:11.760 researchers at Kasperski a Russian cyber
02:16:14.079 security company accidentally detected
02:16:16.239 its traces on their phones
02:16:18.800 the researchers admitted it is the most
02:16:21.040 complex and most advanced attack they've
02:16:23.679 ever dealt with it has all the telltale
02:16:26.239 signs of a state sponsored hacker army
02:16:28.719 and a very powerful one at that at the
02:16:32.080 same time the Federal Security Service
02:16:34.478 the Russian analog of America's NSA
02:16:36.959 announced discovering the same attack
02:16:38.718 patterns on thousands of phones of
02:16:40.638 Russian government officials the service
02:16:43.359 said they managed to identify the
02:16:44.879 attacker American intelligence agencies
02:16:47.840 who spied on Russian citizens in this
02:16:49.840 unparalleled international attack
02:16:52.318 according to the FSB such an attack had
02:16:54.959 to be coordinated with Apple which would
02:16:56.959 not allow bugs like those to remain in
02:16:58.718 their systems without any reason
02:17:01.519 but then there is Operation Zero the
02:17:04.879 company which offered $20 million for
02:17:07.040 the same attack chain hinting that the
02:17:09.200 attack is more than possible without
02:17:11.280 Apple's input just like with most
02:17:13.840 vendors we know very little about
02:17:15.760 Operation Zero but one thing we know and
02:17:18.478 it's a thing the company is out loud and
02:17:20.398 proud about is that it sells its
02:17:22.398 exploits only to Russian intelligence
02:17:24.318 agencies and companies another thing we
02:17:26.959 know is that it was founded by a former
02:17:28.799 employee of Kasperski the same company
02:17:31.280 that was later attacked by Operation
02:17:35.799 Triangulation for a citizen of the
02:17:37.840 United States selling a zero day to
02:17:40.000 Zerodium which would pass it on to the
02:17:41.920 NSA would be the work on the gray market
02:17:44.799 to sell the same bug to operation zero
02:17:47.599 the citizen would have to enter the
02:17:49.200 black market and for a Russian hacker
02:17:52.240 who discovered the same zero day the
02:17:54.398 situation would be strictly reversed
02:17:56.398 contacting Operation Zero would make
02:17:58.398 them a millionaire and contacting
02:18:00.080 Zerodium would likely land them in jail
02:18:03.519 but only a small minority of hackers
02:18:05.359 live in the United States or Russia
02:18:07.439 every country in the world aims to get
02:18:09.200 an edge in cyerspace and each one of
02:18:11.439 them sets its own rules in accordance
02:18:13.439 with its alignment each one has its own
02:18:15.840 white gray and black markets and thanks
02:18:18.879 to the world being as interconnected as
02:18:20.638 it is absolutely nothing prevents one
02:18:23.280 government from reaching out to a black
02:18:25.200 market of another governments that are
02:18:28.080 not looking for morally dubious uh
02:18:31.040 things generally use gray and white
02:18:33.359 markets uh to get those types of
02:18:35.879 vulnerabilities if they go on the black
02:18:38.000 market it's really because they can't
02:18:40.160 get to it in any other way and it gets
02:18:43.200 pretty complicated
02:18:46.799 [Music]
02:18:48.318 both Zerodium and Operation Zero are
02:18:50.879 pretty straightforward they sell to
02:18:52.799 their governments and are transparent
02:18:54.718 about it but when it comes to brokers
02:18:57.920 those two are an
02:18:59.240 exception most companies that trade in
02:19:01.599 zero days work entirely in the shade
02:19:04.240 what they sell and who they sell to and
02:19:06.959 who works for them is a total secret and
02:19:09.599 from what we know they often use that to
02:19:11.760 blur the lines between the markets even
02:19:13.679 more either on accident or not entirely
02:19:17.280 so they may actually um you know sell to
02:19:21.280 not sanctioned regimes cuz that would
02:19:23.359 obviously be illegal but they probably
02:19:25.519 aren't doing like as much due diligence
02:19:28.000 as you might otherwise you know want um
02:19:30.638 and they might even in some cases um you
02:19:33.519 know through that lack of due diligence
02:19:35.359 be working with you know some possibly
02:19:37.679 unwittingly with some cyber criminal but
02:19:39.679 then we have these high-profile
02:19:41.040 incidents where groups like hacking team
02:19:43.120 which was based in Milan Italy um get
02:19:46.318 hacked themselves and we see oh they're
02:19:49.840 selling to uh African nations that have
02:19:54.040 horrific human rights records or to
02:19:57.280 Russia which might not have initially
02:19:59.280 fit these hackers 's moral calculus on
02:20:02.319 who's a good country who's a bad country
02:20:04.240 who has free press and who doesn't and
02:20:06.880 thanks to all this secrecy and all of
02:20:08.800 this blurring imposing any kind of
02:20:10.800 regulation on the zeroday market or even
02:20:13.200 going after anybody who crosses the line
02:20:15.760 becomes nearly impossible prosecuting
02:20:18.800 somebody who is you know themselves
02:20:20.960 anonymous and who facilitates anonymous
02:20:23.600 purchases is very complicated even when
02:20:26.240 you know the parties involved and no one
02:20:28.880 likes doing that um because they also
02:20:31.280 want to see brokers as sources of
02:20:32.960 information so for them it's better to
02:20:35.040 give the broker immunity and get them to
02:20:37.600 cough up whatever they know about uh the
02:20:40.479 deal than to go after them and make
02:20:43.560 additional parties with an interest to
02:20:45.840 cover everything up even more that's why
02:20:48.080 they're not very likely to be prosecuted
02:20:50.960 and this is how the zeroday market
02:20:52.720 operates with no regulation with no
02:20:55.640 prosecution always on the border of
02:20:57.760 legality and morality it is sprawling
02:21:00.720 and complex and at the same time mostly
02:21:03.680 invisible and entirely opaque for people
02:21:07.280 who first learn about it it's difficult
02:21:09.359 to have any kind of positive reaction
02:21:11.680 after all we are speaking about the
02:21:13.439 underground sale of weapons that can be
02:21:15.760 and sometimes are used against every one
02:21:18.319 of us so an urge to regulate or straight
02:21:21.920 up ban can be overwhelming no matter how
02:21:24.399 difficult or impossible that might seem
02:21:27.439 but there can be a different perspective
02:21:29.200 on this a perspective held by a lot of
02:21:31.840 people who used to work in intelligence
02:21:33.680 agencies and witness what governments
02:21:35.680 use their zero days for yeah this this
02:21:38.160 one's a rather you know complex one for
02:21:39.920 me um you know I don't speak purely from
02:21:42.160 opinion a little bit of it from
02:21:43.600 experience um I I think it's well known
02:21:45.840 at this point uh you know that I'm a
02:21:47.359 former intelligence professional and a
02:21:48.880 former government hacker right um and so
02:21:52.399 you know I've seen firsthand the value
02:21:54.560 of um you know the value of retaining an
02:21:56.880 ODA um purely for uh you know purely for
02:22:00.160 offensive purposes of course there's a
02:22:02.240 risk there right and that's why the US
02:22:04.160 government um you know has the
02:22:05.439 vulnerability equities process um where
02:22:08.080 you know very smart people um very smart
02:22:10.880 and very educated people from across
02:22:12.720 different agencies in the government
02:22:14.479 meet about zero days that we have
02:22:16.560 knowledge of and may have may or may not
02:22:18.160 have weaponized may be available for
02:22:20.160 sale what have you and discuss the um
02:22:23.600 you know the value of using it for
02:22:25.760 intelligence versus the value of making
02:22:28.640 our infrastructure safe right and and
02:22:30.720 globally infrastructure say it it's a
02:22:32.880 bit complex for me i I I absolutely
02:22:35.280 can't side with the folks that say all
02:22:38.000 zero days are evil that's that that
02:22:40.560 can't be that that can't be the
02:22:43.960 case what you're looking at now is a
02:22:46.399 theoretical exploit of a vulnerability
02:22:48.319 in PHP a scripting language that forms
02:22:50.800 the backbone of the internet both the
02:22:53.200 visible one such as the page you are on
02:22:55.520 right now and the invisible one the dark
02:22:59.040 web a place you've probably heard of
02:23:01.520 websites and servers there are based on
02:23:03.600 the same principles as regular websites
02:23:06.000 and they are susceptible to the same
02:23:08.600 vulnerabilities sometime in late 2023
02:23:12.000 somebody somewhere discovered a cracked
02:23:15.040 brick in the wall that forms a part of
02:23:17.399 PHP we don't know who that was and why
02:23:20.160 they did it maybe they found the zero
02:23:22.240 day themselves maybe they bought it on
02:23:24.319 the market and then they took that
02:23:26.800 cracked brick and turned it into a
02:23:28.800 passage with that passage they could
02:23:31.280 have accessed any server overtake any
02:23:33.840 website in the world but the website
02:23:35.840 they did attack looked like this it's
02:23:39.520 the dark web blog of Lockbit one of the
02:23:42.319 largest criminal organizations in the
02:23:44.399 world in several years of their
02:23:46.319 existence Lockbit attacked thousands of
02:23:48.560 people and extorted billions after
02:23:50.560 stealing their data and demanding ransom
02:23:53.120 at the height of their activity they
02:23:54.800 comprised almost half of the entire
02:23:56.640 ransomware market in the world in early
02:24:00.120 2024 Lockbit was taken down their whole
02:24:03.439 infrastructure spanning dozens of
02:24:05.439 servers and the accounts of hundreds of
02:24:07.280 cyber criminals was taken over by a
02:24:09.439 combined task force of law enforcement
02:24:11.359 from 11 countries they hit the gang so
02:24:14.240 hard that it practically had to recreate
02:24:16.640 itself a new and might never return to
02:24:19.520 the top of the food chain and this
02:24:22.000 entire operation was most likely
02:24:24.880 conducted thanks to a zero day so yes it
02:24:29.200 can be difficult to admit but sometimes
02:24:31.520 the governments and law enforcement
02:24:33.120 agencies just do their job and sometimes
02:24:37.040 that job requires a well-placed exploit
02:24:40.800 well it could be unethical but the
02:24:42.880 problem is it works both ways yes it
02:24:45.439 could facilitate governments looking to
02:24:47.680 spy on opposition members journalists
02:24:50.479 and and so forth and there are many
02:24:52.800 campaigns constantly attacking
02:24:54.800 governments and companies for doing
02:24:56.960 exactly that it could also be the
02:24:58.880 reverse it could be other governments
02:25:01.040 going after the oppressive governments
02:25:03.280 and trying to cause them problems uh it
02:25:06.319 could also be private initiatives
02:25:08.720 looking for exploits to attack these
02:25:11.439 governments such as what anonymous
02:25:14.080 affiliates were doing against Russia
02:25:15.840 during the war with Ukraine so if you
02:25:17.840 start going after this market it will
02:25:19.840 end up hurting both sides and more
02:25:21.920 likely the governments will win anyway
02:25:23.920 in that scenario because they have more
02:25:27.120 money to spend they're not operating at
02:25:29.439 a risk when they those markets they will
02:25:32.640 use third parties who they'll burn but
02:25:34.880 they'll then they'll find somebody else
02:25:37.280 so everything is a lot blurriier than it
02:25:39.439 might seem the zeroday market is a huge
02:25:42.000 tangled mess of legal and moral
02:25:43.680 questions of companies that sell to
02:25:45.920 criminals and governments alike of
02:25:48.240 agencies that seek exploits and pay
02:25:50.319 millions but call it illegal to use the
02:25:52.800 same exploits against them of criminals
02:25:55.600 attacking governments and governments
02:25:57.520 attacking criminals and of hackers who
02:26:00.399 are the source of it all people who earn
02:26:02.560 their living staring into the
02:26:05.050 [Music]
02:26:08.359 wall most of the zeroday market is
02:26:10.960 completely secret but after all we know
02:26:13.760 about it right so somebody is definitely
02:26:16.479 breaking the first rule of Fight Club
02:26:19.439 sometimes it's former government
02:26:21.120 employees who say as much as they can
02:26:23.280 without crossing the line sometimes it's
02:26:26.560 brokers who want to attract attention
02:26:28.800 both from potential sellers and buyers
02:26:31.840 and sometimes it's hackers themselves
02:26:34.080 who decide to talk despite what others
02:26:36.319 tell them as I document in the book
02:26:39.280 there are various cases where um certain
02:26:43.760 uh brokers there was a very famous one
02:26:46.319 based in uh Thailand i don't know where
02:26:49.280 he is now the Gruck he's a very
02:26:50.960 wellrespected member of the hacking
02:26:53.960 community um spoke to a Forbes reporter
02:26:58.560 a friend of mine Andy Greenberg at one
02:27:01.359 point and thought he was speaking off
02:27:03.439 the record basically the GR shared a lot
02:27:06.240 of information priceless
02:27:09.200 uh you know some rules of the game at
02:27:11.920 one point even posed for a photo next to
02:27:14.080 a duffel bag which I don't know whether
02:27:16.640 there was actual cash in it but it
02:27:18.319 looked like there was cash in it i don't
02:27:20.640 know if it was real or not and from what
02:27:23.520 I understand after that appeared he was
02:27:26.479 visited by Thai police and basically
02:27:29.520 according to friends and colleagues of
02:27:31.920 his um lost half his business because
02:27:34.560 there were a lot of governments who had
02:27:36.160 been buying zero days from him who said
02:27:37.920 I don't want to do business with someone
02:27:40.319 who's going to pose next to a bag a
02:27:42.560 duffel bag of cash in Forbes magazine uh
02:27:45.200 that is the antithesis of who I want to
02:27:48.319 be working with and so that became a
02:27:50.720 very um public example to other zero day
02:27:55.680 brokers that they would do well to keep
02:27:58.479 their mouths shut
02:28:01.600 we tried contacting Grug for this story
02:28:04.080 and it seems he learned his lesson just
02:28:07.520 like almost any zeroday seller or broker
02:28:09.760 you can find on the internet some of
02:28:11.680 them have public profiles some reveal
02:28:14.160 some details of their operations some
02:28:16.399 even share their names but the
02:28:18.880 overwhelming majority have to operate
02:28:21.760 through multiple layers of encryption
02:28:23.760 and when you get to that point of
02:28:25.200 secrecy there's just no way to know who
02:28:27.359 you're dealing with and frankly it's
02:28:29.120 dangerous for you to do to know and
02:28:30.960 that's why it's done particularly in
02:28:32.640 that way so the reason why no one wants
02:28:35.439 to talk about this is one you know their
02:28:38.960 customers require
02:28:41.280 um complete discretion no one no
02:28:44.840 government wants to purchase a zero day
02:28:48.800 from someone who's out there mouththing
02:28:51.479 off about what they have who they're
02:28:55.280 selling it to you know they they need to
02:28:58.399 be able to trust these people to keep
02:29:01.680 these sales quiet so discretion is is
02:29:04.640 critical which is why while we know a
02:29:07.520 lot about the zero-day market there's
02:29:09.520 much more we don't and probably never
02:29:11.680 will even despite the impact it has and
02:29:14.160 will have on our lives so there you go
02:29:17.439 the zeroday market the digital
02:29:19.600 underworld full of elite hackers and
02:29:21.760 horrific secrets a world that sometimes
02:29:24.479 spills into our reality causing massive
02:29:27.160 harm but also a world that is
02:29:30.000 inseparably intertwined with ours with
02:29:32.720 ties that simply can't and probably
02:29:35.200 won't be broken the walls are built by
02:29:39.120 people and as long as that happens some
02:29:42.240 bricks in them will be flawed and as
02:29:45.359 long as there are flawed bricks there
02:29:47.359 will be people who will pay money to
02:29:49.200 have them
02:29:50.120 found and so the zeroday market will
02:29:53.280 persist
02:29:55.040 we hope you enjoyed this short dive into
02:29:57.040 another extremely complicated topic
02:29:59.760 we're very thankful to Nicole Pearllor
02:30:01.920 whose book on zero days served as an
02:30:03.840 inspiration for this
02:30:20.439 story have you heard the news just a few
02:30:23.200 minutes ago there was a massive cyber
02:30:24.880 attack evil hackers struck a major
02:30:27.200 company or was it a government
02:30:29.000 institution maybe a hospital but
02:30:31.760 whatever their target was the
02:30:33.280 authorities were certain of one thing
02:30:35.840 those hackers well they were Russian
02:30:38.800 anywhere you look you'll find their
02:30:40.640 trace companies infrastructure
02:30:43.720 politicians they hack at all nobody can
02:30:47.040 escape them and nobody can catch them
02:30:50.560 but how do they hack who do they work
02:30:53.120 for and most importantly who are they
02:30:56.920 really to find that out let's dive into
02:31:00.080 the dark world of Russian
02:31:07.960 hackers meet Leonid he's a 16-year-old
02:31:12.000 from a large Russian city leonid spends
02:31:14.880 his mornings at school although he
02:31:17.280 doesn't like it very much while there he
02:31:20.319 yearns to return home to a sprawling
02:31:22.640 suburb where his mom's apartment
02:31:25.080 is leonid doesn't go out much though he
02:31:28.319 spends most of his time on the computer
02:31:30.880 he loves games cars war movies and cool
02:31:34.840 music leonid also loves his country he's
02:31:38.560 not into politics not at all but he
02:31:41.359 knows one thing his country is in grave
02:31:44.319 danger
02:31:45.760 it is as everybody surely should
02:31:48.160 understand beset by enemies clues about
02:31:51.120 that are everywhere on TV on the
02:31:53.920 internet all over the place everything
02:31:57.040 aligns everything shows that the whole
02:31:59.600 world is against Russia the only goal of
02:32:02.720 the entire West is to destroy Leonid's
02:32:05.680 country and its people well at least
02:32:08.720 that's what Leonid reads on the internet
02:32:10.560 and sees on TV
02:32:12.640 he's absolutely sure that everything bad
02:32:15.359 that ever happened in Russia is the
02:32:17.280 result of foreign
02:32:18.680 conspiracies corrupting Western
02:32:20.720 influence is why Leonit's father had
02:32:22.880 problems with alcoholism and had to
02:32:25.040 leave it's why the economy is stagnating
02:32:28.080 and the family is barely holding on even
02:32:30.720 despite the payouts it's why Leonid no
02:32:33.600 longer has a brother
02:32:36.160 not everybody in Leonid's immediate
02:32:38.560 vicinity understands the connection
02:32:40.399 though and it frustrates the boy
02:32:43.000 immensely he wants to act to do
02:32:46.120 something leonid's brother wanted to act
02:32:48.720 too and join the army leonid is neither
02:32:52.319 as brave nor as stupid as that no he
02:32:55.600 knows that if you want to defeat
02:32:57.200 Russia's enemies you have to be smart
02:33:00.479 and so when he returns home from school
02:33:03.120 Leonid becomes somebody else he becomes
02:33:06.560 the dark
02:33:07.960 diver he's just a cog in a much bigger
02:33:10.800 movement he knows that but Leonid learns
02:33:13.760 fast the crew he belongs to is growing
02:33:16.880 just a few months ago there were a
02:33:18.640 handful of them now it's dozens and
02:33:21.200 together they can do a lot higher
02:33:24.399 ranking members of Leonid's gang are
02:33:26.160 smart they follow the news and have a
02:33:28.479 good grasp of what's what every few days
02:33:31.280 they lay out a set of targets and create
02:33:33.359 a plan the group mostly does DOS
02:33:36.560 distributed denial of service they use a
02:33:39.359 botnet a collection of infected devices
02:33:42.000 all across the world to send requests
02:33:44.240 and jam the target server taking it down
02:33:47.120 the crew's botnet isn't very big but
02:33:49.439 it's enough for some tasks whenever they
02:33:51.840 need something more powerful they chip
02:33:53.840 in and buy some traffic from a vendor on
02:33:55.680 the dark web leonid's crew also probes
02:33:58.800 websites and looks for a chance to
02:34:00.560 deface them or maybe steal some data
02:34:03.439 they scrape leaks for credentials and
02:34:05.280 sometimes send out fishing emails
02:34:07.359 anything that would allow them to get to
02:34:08.880 the target on a rare occasion they
02:34:11.600 infect the computer of their target with
02:34:13.120 ransomware making it
02:34:15.319 unusable their techniques are varied and
02:34:17.920 so are their targets but there's one
02:34:20.000 thing that ties those targets together
02:34:22.240 all of them every single one are in the
02:34:25.040 countries Russia considers its enemies
02:34:28.000 one target may be an institution of some
02:34:30.319 European country whose leadership said
02:34:32.399 something bad about Russia another one
02:34:34.960 may be some American company because of
02:34:37.600 course America's the main enemy of
02:34:39.720 Russia every other day the target is in
02:34:42.560 Ukraine because that's just how the war
02:34:44.960 works every time they attack Ukraine
02:34:47.600 Leonid remembers his brother and thinks
02:34:49.920 about how proud he would be leonid
02:34:53.359 considers himself a activist one of
02:34:55.760 thousands across the country and beyond
02:34:58.640 i think if if you were to use a sports
02:35:00.720 analogy activists are sort of your minor
02:35:03.439 league players they are often students
02:35:06.560 or grad students or recent graduates who
02:35:09.040 are trying to make a name for themselves
02:35:10.960 they're trying to distinguish themselves
02:35:12.960 with bold tax usually idealistic
02:35:16.200 nationalistic driven individuals with an
02:35:19.040 agenda activist used to be independent
02:35:21.760 so they used to be something like uh an
02:35:24.319 individual groups that work on behalf of
02:35:26.640 their leaders of their teams on of their
02:35:29.040 I don't know maybe their beliefs let's
02:35:30.479 call it this way in what they wanted to
02:35:33.280 achieve the most famous one being Kilnet
02:35:36.560 Zary something like anonymous Russia
02:35:39.120 that's been on the news lately again why
02:35:41.680 why speaking about news because that's
02:35:43.680 what their aim they they want to you
02:35:45.760 know pop up to be noticed to people to
02:35:48.399 talk about their activity chances are if
02:35:51.200 you've heard about some prominent and
02:35:53.439 annoying cyber attack recently
02:35:55.520 Leonitute's group was responsible for it
02:35:58.000 not because the attack itself was
02:35:59.600 damaging but because the group found a
02:36:01.840 way to spin it they chose a target that
02:36:04.960 would be easily noticeable something you
02:36:07.520 couldn't just ignore then they attacked
02:36:10.080 it using the easiest way possible
02:36:12.399 whether the attack succeeded or not they
02:36:14.640 posted about it on their social media
02:36:16.880 the post exaggerated the whole story of
02:36:18.960 it or maybe quite a lot but who's going
02:36:22.160 to check anyway in the blink of an eye
02:36:25.040 the story was picked up by every other
02:36:26.800 activist group spreading it farther and
02:36:29.120 farther eventually influencers news
02:36:31.760 accounts all kinds of people began
02:36:34.000 sharing it before long the news about
02:36:37.040 the attack reached papers and TV
02:36:39.120 channels and now everybody has heard of
02:36:41.200 the operation Leonid's gang pulled off
02:36:43.760 by that time the effects of the attack
02:36:45.760 have probably been mitigated but that's
02:36:48.240 not the
02:36:49.160 point the publicity the buzz the sense
02:36:52.880 that their targets are vulnerable and
02:36:54.880 the gang can do everything that's the
02:36:58.520 intention the end goal of Leonid's
02:37:01.200 operation is to cause as much arbitrary
02:37:03.760 damage as possible to be the agents of
02:37:06.240 chaos who see doubt anger and mistrust
02:37:09.359 in everything they
02:37:10.920 touch in Leonid's mind that's the only
02:37:14.080 way to fight the enemy who's as strong
02:37:16.080 as the one they are fighting the West as
02:37:19.840 in the entirety of it all the
02:37:22.399 governments companies and people that
02:37:24.640 belong to this nebulous and everchanging
02:37:27.359 group because if you're in Russia every
02:37:30.399 bit of information you get points to one
02:37:32.640 thing they are responsible for the woes
02:37:35.840 of the Russian people leonid hates the
02:37:39.200 West with the entirety of his heart and
02:37:41.760 directs his angst to these long nights
02:37:43.760 in front of the computer they give his
02:37:46.160 life meaning and he can't imagine things
02:37:48.720 any other way in a sense he's addicted
02:37:52.160 to hacking the feeling it gives him the
02:37:55.120 thrills the satisfaction the rush of
02:37:57.760 adrenaline when something large crashes
02:38:00.000 and burns video games can't provide this
02:38:03.040 kind of joy and real life doesn't even
02:38:05.600 come close leonid never felt this kind
02:38:08.640 of camaraderie with his school buddies
02:38:10.640 and he no longer has friends beyond
02:38:12.720 other hackers in the gang as the boy
02:38:15.600 dawn his alter ego he is no longer alone
02:38:19.040 he's no longer in a crumbling apartment
02:38:20.960 block on the outskirts of the city he's
02:38:23.359 in a tribe a team a community that
02:38:26.960 strives to change the world for the
02:38:28.720 better one downed American website one
02:38:32.160 interrupted European service one jammed
02:38:35.280 Ukrainian server at a time so far Leon
02:38:39.200 did never consider earning money for his
02:38:40.800 hacking endeavors but one day if it all
02:38:43.840 goes well that may happen at least there
02:38:47.600 are people who managed to pull it off
02:38:51.670 [Music]
02:38:57.439 this is Peter he lives in the same
02:39:00.640 apartment block as Leonid although they
02:39:03.439 don't really know each other peter is in
02:39:06.640 his 30s he doesn't work anywhere at
02:39:09.439 least officially well he tried many
02:39:12.399 times but that didn't last being a desk
02:39:15.200 drone drove Peter mad so he quit even
02:39:18.319 before Russia's IT market disintegrated
02:39:21.439 an office job also didn't really meet
02:39:24.080 Peter's financial needs peter is not
02:39:28.240 very good with money he loves nice
02:39:30.319 things maybe a bit too much who can
02:39:33.040 blame him back in school Peter's teacher
02:39:36.319 always said that he's smart but lazy but
02:39:39.760 when something interests Peter he can be
02:39:42.000 the most hardworking person in the world
02:39:44.399 having nice things interests Peter a lot
02:39:47.120 and so he found a job that can fulfill
02:39:49.120 his needs and give him an outlet to his
02:39:51.720 talents peter began
02:39:55.399 hacking not real hacking at least not
02:39:58.640 how some of Peter's superiors see it
02:40:00.960 more like hacking by proxy so the job is
02:40:04.399 simple convincing as many people as
02:40:06.479 possible to download a small file peter
02:40:10.000 does that by collecting leaked
02:40:11.479 credentials emails nicknames passwords
02:40:14.720 he then stuffs them into login pages of
02:40:16.640 social media accounts looking for
02:40:18.520 matches in an unlikely chance of success
02:40:21.760 the password works and Peter adds the
02:40:24.000 unlocked account to his loyal army of
02:40:26.080 robots those robots then do his bidding
02:40:29.359 contacting the entirety of their friend
02:40:31.200 list with a simple message bearing a
02:40:33.840 small attachment
02:40:35.840 most of this process is automated and
02:40:38.000 Peter has only a vague understanding of
02:40:39.920 how it works but even that understanding
02:40:42.720 is more than enough the file Peter sends
02:40:45.920 out is malicious it's also so
02:40:48.399 welldesigned that a child could use it
02:40:51.040 peter pays a small fee for access to
02:40:53.120 that file it's easy fast it's like a
02:40:55.439 franchise now so you can buy a
02:40:57.680 ransomware for a day or for a week get
02:40:59.920 rich that's what they think and you know
02:41:02.560 leave to another country with full uh
02:41:04.880 bags of money but yeah that that's
02:41:06.640 nothing that happens in the real world
02:41:08.640 now as soon as Peter joined the gang a
02:41:10.960 few years ago he immediately got lucky a
02:41:14.000 few successful jobs in a row allowed him
02:41:16.080 to get all the things he wanted for a
02:41:18.319 while he was living like a king his
02:41:21.520 success ended quite soon though and
02:41:24.000 Peter kept chasing that high ever since
02:41:26.720 successful attacks still happen peter
02:41:29.200 can't complain at least it's better than
02:41:31.600 trying to find a real job also he got
02:41:34.319 lucky once so who says it can't happen
02:41:36.880 again these ransomware kind of attacks
02:41:39.760 allow well-educated individuals to make
02:41:43.520 a lot of money um very very quickly with
02:41:46.399 all the sanctions that have taken place
02:41:48.399 within Russia since the invasion of the
02:41:50.960 Ukraine it has created even less
02:41:53.280 economic opportunity and I think the
02:41:55.600 government in Russia has become even
02:41:58.240 more tolerant or even supportive of
02:42:00.720 ransomware groups because all of these
02:42:02.640 groups are bringing money into the
02:42:05.840 Russian economy law enforcement was
02:42:08.880 never interested in how ransomware
02:42:10.880 operators earn their income peter is
02:42:13.439 pretty sure the police are well aware of
02:42:15.359 what he does but they just don't care
02:42:17.600 about that there's only one thing that
02:42:20.800 could bother them and that's Peter
02:42:22.960 crossing the line a part of Peter's job
02:42:25.439 is to know who his targets are and it's
02:42:28.240 an important part anybody who lives in
02:42:30.640 Russia and friendly countries is off
02:42:33.240 limits larger Russian companies are so
02:42:36.240 far behind the red line that it's almost
02:42:38.399 as if they don't exist thankfully most
02:42:41.600 of this process is automated too the
02:42:43.680 malware detects the language settings of
02:42:45.520 the victim's device and doesn't activate
02:42:47.680 if Russian is selected however if the
02:42:50.479 target from Russia gets infected anyway
02:42:53.040 Peter might be in trouble the bosses
02:42:55.760 then dispatch a team of real hackers get
02:42:58.160 in touch with the target and sort out
02:43:00.479 the problem this happened to Peter's
02:43:02.880 victim once he got a sizable penalty and
02:43:06.000 doesn't want the story to repeat
02:43:08.560 it's pretty well known what happens to
02:43:10.240 habitual line crossers people who attack
02:43:13.359 forbidden targets despite the rules in
02:43:16.240 the best cases they lose their business
02:43:18.399 and have no chance of joining any gang
02:43:20.960 particularly annoying ones get visited
02:43:23.200 by local thugs in the real world and if
02:43:26.720 a hacker crosses the line one too many
02:43:29.160 times if he really steps on the toes of
02:43:32.640 people who shouldn't be touched he gets
02:43:34.960 the worst punishment of all the
02:43:37.960 law peter doesn't know anyone who's been
02:43:40.600 arrested but he's seen some of them on
02:43:42.880 the news and the prospect of getting
02:43:44.880 paraded in front of the whole country in
02:43:46.560 handcuffs doesn't look very
02:43:48.680 enticing as far as Peter understands
02:43:51.520 it's not politics it's much simpler than
02:43:53.920 that you don't attack your own family
02:43:57.040 and if you do well you only have
02:43:59.120 yourself to blame so Peter picks his
02:44:01.920 targets carefully people in the West are
02:44:04.479 much richer anyway so why even bother
02:44:07.200 with Russian targets you know the
02:44:09.040 ransomware groups grew out of the
02:44:12.319 dissolution of the Soviet Union and I
02:44:15.439 think that the rampant inflation and the
02:44:18.800 privatization of industries left a lot
02:44:21.840 of very highly educated people without a
02:44:25.200 means of making an income and they
02:44:28.720 turned to these types of attacks for
02:44:31.279 economic advantage while quite new to
02:44:34.160 the whole ransomware game Peter
02:44:36.000 considered himself a hacker for a long
02:44:37.840 time he got his first computer back in
02:44:40.160 the '90s and quickly learned that you
02:44:42.399 don't have to pay money for things like
02:44:44.000 video games if you're clever enough it
02:44:47.439 was a different time a wild time back
02:44:50.880 then Peter couldn't even imagine that
02:44:52.800 hacking can be as profitable a business
02:44:54.720 as it is now well at least to some
02:44:59.040 everybody knows hackers who earn
02:45:00.560 millions without breaking a sweat
02:45:02.640 someday after some successful attack
02:45:05.200 Peter might become one of those too just
02:45:08.479 one good job to buy a new car maybe a
02:45:12.000 new flat in a nicer part of town or
02:45:15.040 maybe if things turn out really well
02:45:17.279 just leave everything and get away from
02:45:19.200 it all to Dubai Ishanbul even
02:45:23.080 Europe one good
02:45:26.120 job peter likes to sit like that and
02:45:28.960 think about all the nice things he'll
02:45:30.399 get after hitting a jackpot
02:45:32.640 but now he's just noticed that he's all
02:45:34.960 out of cigarettes on his way down to the
02:45:37.359 shop Peter passes the door of a neighbor
02:45:39.359 he's never seen the doors always
02:45:42.520 closed peter doesn't know it but if he
02:45:45.600 ever messes up at work really really bad
02:45:49.200 he might get a chance at finally meeting
02:45:51.279 the man who lives there
02:46:01.200 the next chapter's loading so you can
02:46:03.359 still hit that subscribe button while we
02:46:04.960 have time okay almost over
02:46:08.600 now peter's neighbor is
02:46:11.720 Andre right now he's at work andre
02:46:15.279 leaves early and comes back late he's
02:46:18.240 divorced in his early 40s and doesn't
02:46:21.120 have friends he wouldn't have time for
02:46:23.279 them anyway
02:46:25.120 andre finished university at the top of
02:46:27.279 his class computer engineering while
02:46:29.920 studying he didn't even think about
02:46:31.520 joining the military but one day his
02:46:33.600 class was visited by a recruiter who
02:46:35.680 offered a very enticing offer andre is
02:46:39.279 quite good at finding vulnerabilities in
02:46:41.200 computer systems there's a need for
02:46:43.520 people with this skill the recruiter
02:46:45.279 said if Andre wants to earn a passable
02:46:47.920 income he can join some local tech
02:46:50.240 company and spend the rest of his life
02:46:52.000 slaving away at a desk job always
02:46:54.240 overworked and always on the verge of
02:46:56.319 getting fired or he could work for the
02:46:59.319 government the recruiter was one from
02:47:01.840 the GRU the military intelligence of the
02:47:04.479 Russian armed forces it responds
02:47:06.880 directly to the general staff the very
02:47:09.680 top of the Russian military its members
02:47:12.160 aren't your regular soldiers they're an
02:47:14.720 elite the very best Russia has to offer
02:47:18.240 andre joined and never looked back
02:47:21.600 right now he's in a grand building in
02:47:23.439 the center of the city by a desk where
02:47:25.279 he spends most of his time the
02:47:27.359 environment isn't dynamic but after a
02:47:29.840 decade and a half Andre got used to that
02:47:32.560 he likes it the predictability the
02:47:35.120 discipline the order he even got used to
02:47:37.680 the uniform which seemed like overkill
02:47:40.080 at first the work itself is hard but
02:47:43.439 satisfying you have to learn and adapt
02:47:46.160 there are lots of challenges but that's
02:47:48.240 the cost of being at the top of the game
02:47:51.279 andre does not just hack things he does
02:47:54.960 that on a level only a handful of people
02:47:57.359 in the world ever reach and his targets
02:47:59.680 reflect that sometimes Andre's unit
02:48:02.240 attacks foreign governments they
02:48:04.160 infiltrate agencies parties the very
02:48:07.359 lives of world famous
02:48:09.880 politicians sometimes they attack
02:48:12.160 foreign companies typically those in the
02:48:14.479 defense or cyber security business but
02:48:17.439 the most satisfying results come from
02:48:19.600 breaching infrastructure breaking into
02:48:22.160 power plants factories industrial
02:48:24.479 control
02:48:25.560 networks andre is in awe of it the power
02:48:29.200 he feels when he holds the lives of
02:48:31.200 thousands of people in his hands one
02:48:34.240 press of a button and they're gone a
02:48:37.200 mass tragedy a world war a lot rests on
02:48:40.880 one click andre is addicted to that
02:48:44.000 feeling and there's nothing he would
02:48:45.920 agree to exchange for moments like these
02:48:48.479 in particular I think that targeting
02:48:50.160 critical infrastructure targeting OT SCA
02:48:53.120 devices that's where it all began and
02:48:55.120 that's what we see now a lot of
02:48:56.479 companies in US for example at the
02:48:58.319 moment are being targeted especially the
02:49:00.080 one that do water supplies of course
02:49:02.960 everything Andre does is strictly
02:49:05.000 supervised his agency isn't after death
02:49:07.760 and destruction what the superiors
02:49:10.000 really need are military and trade
02:49:12.000 secrets when necessary they inflict just
02:49:15.120 enough damage to show that the team was
02:49:16.960 there no more no less gru is just one of
02:49:21.920 many Russian institutions that do this
02:49:24.000 kind of job there's the FSB the Federal
02:49:26.800 Security Service andre never met their
02:49:29.200 hackers but people say they're smug and
02:49:31.920 undisiplined many of them aren't even
02:49:34.120 officers there's the SVR the Foreign
02:49:36.800 Intelligence Service andre collaborated
02:49:39.120 with them once or twice they're
02:49:40.800 competent but most of their work
02:49:42.319 involves informationational attacks
02:49:44.160 political espionage and such useless
02:49:46.720 tasks in Andre's opinion and of course
02:49:50.479 there are the
02:49:51.560 civilians thousands upon thousands of
02:49:54.319 them they're difficult to control more
02:49:56.720 of a mob than an army some of them hack
02:49:59.120 for political reasons others seek
02:50:01.279 financial gain in addition to hacking
02:50:03.840 Andre's unit also controls and
02:50:05.840 orchestrates the civilian attacks picks
02:50:08.160 and clears targets draws lines and
02:50:10.800 punishes the misbehaving hackers i might
02:50:13.279 assume that a lot of activists now
02:50:15.359 especially in Russia they're under
02:50:16.960 government control that's why I was
02:50:19.040 saying about them targeting the same
02:50:20.720 goals so they might be achieving
02:50:22.640 something like an order or something
02:50:24.560 like a target they need to to hit and
02:50:26.960 they are doing this one by one of course
02:50:30.640 you wouldn't pick a hackist or even a
02:50:32.720 ransomware operator to do a real
02:50:34.560 hacker's job they won't be able to
02:50:36.560 infiltrate a defense contractor or break
02:50:38.560 into an email server of a political
02:50:40.319 party that's the work of Andre and his
02:50:43.399 colleagues but even a disorganized mob
02:50:46.080 of script kitties still has its uses but
02:50:49.279 again if we try to remember that there
02:50:51.359 is a different goal for for different
02:50:53.279 security operations then you understand
02:50:55.040 that some operations are being designed
02:50:58.000 just to showcase that they've been done
02:51:00.080 that they were they were implemented
02:51:01.840 that the goal was achieved and others
02:51:03.920 are staying undercover the other reason
02:51:05.840 might be something like you know when a
02:51:07.600 magician does his trick he usually shows
02:51:10.160 something in front but the real action
02:51:11.680 is done on the background so that might
02:51:13.680 be also a trick so when you try to focus
02:51:16.399 attention of cyber security authorities
02:51:18.800 let's say in US into water supply grid
02:51:21.520 at the same time you might be targeting
02:51:23.040 something else so you put their
02:51:24.800 attention in in the other spot just to
02:51:26.640 make sure that you do all the action all
02:51:28.560 the important action in quite other
02:51:30.720 direction
02:51:32.319 andre isn't too pleased with civilian
02:51:34.160 hackers but he understands that they're
02:51:36.160 a valuable asset for the country they
02:51:38.640 provide cannon fodder a cheap way to
02:51:40.960 conduct a lot of attacks or in the worst
02:51:43.439 case at least a
02:51:45.319 distraction they're also the future the
02:51:48.240 kids among them will grow up one day get
02:51:50.640 bored of hacking for fun they'll want a
02:51:52.960 better life and a real purpose to work
02:51:55.319 for andre used to be just like them back
02:51:58.399 in the day in his teenage years before
02:52:00.800 he was a hacker he frequented the same
02:52:03.040 forums as Peter and unbeknownst to
02:52:05.520 anybody a lot of that very convenient
02:52:07.680 software Peter uses draws roots from
02:52:10.160 things Andre wrote in his youth it was
02:52:13.120 malware quick and dirty exploits to be
02:52:15.439 dropped on the dark web for all to use
02:52:17.920 but Andre's first love was cracking
02:52:20.560 games at first then work programs then
02:52:23.439 industrial software that could be sold
02:52:24.880 to Russian businesses and provide
02:52:26.560 teenage Andre with enough money to
02:52:28.479 sustain his hacking hobby the percentage
02:52:30.479 of software that is cracked or not
02:52:32.800 properly licensed in Russia is and I
02:52:34.880 would say it's in excess of 90% if you
02:52:37.200 get into the very sophisticated tools
02:52:40.240 that are used for designing electronics
02:52:43.040 and mechanical engineering and chemical
02:52:45.200 engineering and these types of
02:52:46.800 applications i think a lot of these
02:52:48.640 things are now embargoed so you cannot
02:52:51.120 even purchase legitimate copies of these
02:52:53.279 kind of design tools today so it's
02:52:55.279 almost forced piracy but even before the
02:52:58.000 sanctions went into effect Russian
02:52:59.920 industry ran off of unlicensed or
02:53:02.000 cracked kind of software but besides
02:53:04.800 money there was one more thing that this
02:53:07.040 kind of activity
02:53:08.600 provided
02:53:10.279 power the first time Andre felt it he
02:53:13.600 was still a teenager hooked on the
02:53:15.359 internet through a landline in his
02:53:16.800 parents' flat he remembers looking at
02:53:19.040 the wire a line of metal encased in
02:53:21.680 transparent plastic pondering how so
02:53:24.560 much can be done through such a thin
02:53:26.680 connection the whole world could fit
02:53:29.040 through there and bend to his will with
02:53:31.200 just a handful of clever math tricks it
02:53:34.160 was a sense of power Andre never found
02:53:36.560 anywhere else and he hasn't been able to
02:53:39.120 let go of it ever since sure the '9s and
02:53:43.040 Russia were full of chaos and poverty
02:53:45.920 but Andre remembers the hacker scene of
02:53:48.240 that time very fondly the decade was
02:53:50.960 full of opportunity it hooked Andre on
02:53:53.520 hacking and instilled in him a sense of
02:53:55.680 purpose it's that feeling that brought
02:53:58.000 him to the GRU and gave him the life he
02:54:00.240 has now the '90s brought up an entire
02:54:03.279 generation of hackers who had skills and
02:54:05.680 motivation who could do so much with so
02:54:08.479 few
02:54:09.319 resources if things went differently
02:54:11.760 those people would be the backbone of a
02:54:13.439 strong IT industry maybe in some other
02:54:16.240 alternative world Russia is the cyber
02:54:18.479 security powerhouse with the most
02:54:20.240 skilled ethical hackers he could find in
02:54:22.960 that world Andre is probably heading a
02:54:25.439 prominent cyber security company leonid
02:54:28.080 is participating in hacking competitions
02:54:30.240 and honing his skills before becoming a
02:54:32.479 well-known researcher and Peter works
02:54:34.960 with customers helping them solve their
02:54:36.640 problems instead of creating ones
02:54:39.520 but that alternative world does not
02:54:41.960 exist this reality is all we have and in
02:54:45.760 it Russia has no place for ethical
02:54:48.439 hackers the easiest path for curious and
02:54:51.600 skilled people is the path of cyber
02:54:53.840 crime it's the only way for them to
02:54:55.840 satisfy their addiction an addiction the
02:54:58.479 path both creates and feeds because the
02:55:02.080 Russian state itself is addicted to
02:55:04.399 cyber crime too it's an integral part of
02:55:06.800 its foreign policy economy and life a
02:55:10.160 quick high instead of the slow and
02:55:12.319 painful process of development just like
02:55:15.279 any addiction it's a vicious cycle and
02:55:18.319 there's no indication that it's going to
02:55:20.560 stop
02:55:22.560 or
02:55:23.720 maybe there
02:55:34.040 is all the characters depicted in this
02:55:36.640 video are fictional we created them by
02:55:39.120 combining everything we know about the
02:55:40.880 Russian hacker world into a few easily
02:55:43.200 understandable bits but behind these
02:55:45.120 characters are real people with real
02:55:47.359 lives the real Russian hackers they are
02:55:50.720 people people who have their own
02:55:52.319 motivations for what they do and who
02:55:54.240 spread fear and misery with a clear and
02:55:56.800 deliberate intention and behind those
02:55:58.640 people is a state for which conducting
02:56:00.560 cyber crime is an official way of doing
02:56:02.720 things crashing websites pushing
02:56:04.960 ransomware spreading disinformation and
02:56:07.680 advancing its agenda in any way possible
02:56:10.319 that's how Russian foreign policy works
02:56:12.640 we know quite a lot about the inside
02:56:14.720 life of the Russian hacking scene there
02:56:16.720 are insider reports whistleblowers
02:56:19.200 people who infiltrated and researched
02:56:21.120 that world and while we don't know a lot
02:56:23.520 about what happens at the very top of it
02:56:25.680 we can infer the intentions of the
02:56:27.359 people who are in charge however there
02:56:30.240 is one question which remains open can
02:56:33.200 Russia get rid of its addiction to cyber
02:56:35.600 crime is it not too late to change maybe
02:56:38.720 start investing time and resources into
02:56:40.800 becoming a productive technology hub and
02:56:43.359 let go of the high that ultimately gets
02:56:45.359 you nowhere well not doing anything
02:56:47.840 about that is easier that's for sure but
02:56:50.319 is the country and most importantly the
02:56:53.200 people in it better that
02:57:03.640 way touchdown telephones look like this
02:57:07.040 it's not a computer it can't connect to
02:57:09.760 the internet can you hack with it well
02:57:13.279 no not really but maybe just maybe
02:57:16.800 there's one man who can and this man's
02:57:19.520 name is Kevin Mitnik and I was in court
02:57:22.640 and I thought I was going home that day
02:57:24.560 and then this federal prosecutor tells
02:57:26.720 the judge that we not only have to hold
02:57:29.359 Mr mitnik without bail but we have to
02:57:32.240 make sure he can't get to a telephone
02:57:36.720 kevin Mitnik kevin Mitnik kevin Mitnik
02:57:39.680 kevin David Mitnik kevin Mitnik was
02:57:42.000 arrested twice first in 1988 and then
02:57:45.120 again in 1995 both times he was barred
02:57:48.080 from operating both a computer and a
02:57:50.319 telephone because of a danger to
02:57:52.000 national security the government put him
02:57:54.160 in solitary confinement to prevent all
02:57:56.080 unsupervised communication with the
02:57:57.680 outside world however him talking to a
02:58:00.640 telephone was by far not their biggest
02:58:02.560 worry the real problem was that he would
02:58:05.680 start
02:58:07.240 whistling and to understand what's wrong
02:58:09.680 with that we have to go back all the way
02:58:12.720 back to the
02:58:15.880 '60s the '60s created many iconic sounds
02:58:19.439 like this one
02:58:23.359 and this one
02:58:26.960 and also this
02:58:30.200 one this is the sound of a telephone
02:58:33.000 communicating it transmits information
02:58:35.200 through frequencies who calls who where
02:58:38.160 and so on for the old phones these
02:58:40.560 sounds were the only ways to communicate
02:58:42.399 information about the call to the
02:58:44.160 switchboard so if you have another way
02:58:46.240 of creating these sounds you can
02:58:48.080 communicate with the switchboard too and
02:58:50.160 in this way you can relay a lot more
02:58:52.319 than just the number you want to call
02:58:54.240 there was a huge elaborate system of
02:58:56.240 signals used to transfer all kinds of
02:58:58.240 information through the phone lines
02:59:00.160 manipulating these frequencies would
02:59:01.920 grant you near absolute control over the
02:59:04.080 system and the people who harnessed that
02:59:06.000 ability were called freakers freakers
02:59:08.880 were the original hackers they used a
02:59:11.279 huge array of gadgets tools and tricks
02:59:13.760 to play with the phone lines for fun and
02:59:16.000 for profit the Captain Crunch whistle
02:59:18.080 and if you glue this hole right here
02:59:19.920 like
02:59:21.640 this that's 2600 one of the things that
02:59:24.720 we used to do is to go to the go to the
02:59:26.560 airport walk along blowing the whistle
02:59:28.640 next to a bank of
02:59:32.680 payones and disconnect their calls and
02:59:35.680 as the 70s approached the phenomenon
02:59:38.000 became endemic there was this
02:59:40.080 understanding that wherever phone lines
02:59:41.920 reach freakers can reach
02:59:44.120 too schools hospitals government
02:59:47.640 institutions everything was just a call
02:59:50.000 away you know what else had phone lines
02:59:52.800 military bases and you know what else
02:59:54.960 those bases had
02:59:56.920 nukes the myths about freer's abilities
02:59:59.760 to connect to the US nuclear arsenal go
03:00:02.240 almost as far as freakers themselves one
03:00:04.479 of the earliest examples we have comes
03:00:06.479 from
03:00:07.399 1975 a young freaker named Paul Sheridan
03:00:10.479 boasted to his friend a police informant
03:00:12.640 about accessing every phone in the state
03:00:15.040 according to Paul he could call the US
03:00:17.760 Air Force bases and order them to
03:00:19.600 scramble the nuclear bombers and the
03:00:22.080 military would comply was this true no
03:00:26.240 not really the military used a whole
03:00:28.640 separate phone network from the civilian
03:00:30.319 one with its own structure and signals
03:00:33.040 and almost no possibility of reaching it
03:00:35.279 from the outside world the only part of
03:00:37.680 military communication that could be
03:00:39.439 reached by freakers was Autovon a
03:00:42.080 special network for non-secure calls
03:00:44.319 which used the civilian phone lines by
03:00:46.880 its nature it was easily accessible so
03:00:49.600 the military never used it to transmit
03:00:51.600 secret or sensitive information after
03:00:54.160 breaking into it the most freakers could
03:00:56.240 do is listen on some trivial chatter and
03:00:58.960 maybe prank a soldier or two issuing an
03:01:01.840 order let alone scrambling bombers
03:01:04.080 through Ottabon was completely
03:01:05.880 impossible but a myth was born and
03:01:08.240 continued to proliferate then came the8s
03:01:11.040 and freakers turned into hackers a
03:01:13.600 lecturer demonstrates not only how to
03:01:15.680 get into a computer but also how to
03:01:18.160 change things once you're in like a
03:01:20.640 student's examination result well we use
03:01:23.200 the telephone to dial up the polytenic
03:01:25.520 computer and via an acoustic coupler
03:01:27.520 which just changes the computer signals
03:01:29.439 into sound so the telephone could handle
03:01:31.200 it nuclear bombers were no longer
03:01:33.240 relevant it was the future the military
03:01:36.160 used missiles satellites and
03:01:38.439 supercomputers everything was more
03:01:40.319 connected and with that everything
03:01:42.240 seemed more vulnerable to this new
03:01:44.000 elusive danger what could be done with
03:01:46.240 these tools tapping and overtaking
03:01:48.720 military lines breaking into satellites
03:01:51.439 launching missiles the prospect was
03:01:53.439 terrifying the media loved it computer
03:01:56.080 crime has become so sophisticated that
03:01:58.160 the criminal can instruct the computer
03:01:59.920 to fiddle its owner and then instruct
03:02:01.920 the computer to forget it did it then
03:02:04.080 1983 came and with it the release of War
03:02:07.200 Games the film catalyzed fears and
03:02:09.520 stereotypes people had about hackers
03:02:11.760 we're in and condensed them into a
03:02:14.000 catchy visual form you have a young
03:02:15.680 hacker who doesn't know what he's doing
03:02:17.520 how's that i don't know but it's great
03:02:20.240 you have the system that can't stop him
03:02:24.560 and you have the everpresent shadow of
03:02:26.399 total annihilation the protagonist
03:02:28.640 brought the world to the brink of
03:02:30.000 collapse by accident so what could a
03:02:33.120 person with actual malicious intent do
03:02:35.840 there was another element of the puzzle
03:02:37.840 the setting of a high-tech drama
03:02:39.439 required technology complicated machines
03:02:42.160 used by freakers and hackers to bend the
03:02:44.479 emerging cyber world to their command
03:02:46.640 the most popular of these machines were
03:02:48.319 called boxes they could create
03:02:50.240 frequencies to hack telephone lines the
03:02:52.800 more complicated boxes you could build
03:02:54.880 the more successful your freaking would
03:02:56.640 be but what if you didn't need boxes
03:02:59.040 what if the phone signals could be
03:03:00.479 created with no tools whatsoever after
03:03:03.279 all what we're talking about here are
03:03:05.120 sounds and human physiology seems
03:03:07.439 perfectly equipped to create them on its
03:03:09.319 own this is Joe and
03:03:13.640 Gracia a blind freaker demonstrating the
03:03:16.720 only documented case of using human
03:03:18.880 voice to manipulate phone lines but
03:03:21.200 phone should be ringing about
03:03:23.479 now okay it hit the phone and Gracia was
03:03:26.880 also one of the very few freakers to
03:03:28.880 dial into the Autobon system the FBI
03:03:31.520 even started investigating his abilities
03:03:33.359 in 1969 but quickly came to the
03:03:36.000 conclusion that he possessed no real
03:03:38.080 danger to national security and dropped
03:03:40.160 the case and Gracia was only arrested 2
03:03:42.880 years later and charged with avoiding
03:03:44.720 payment for long-distance calls because
03:03:47.040 that was the extent of the damage he
03:03:48.720 could do while whistling but that didn't
03:03:50.880 stop the myths they grew and bloomed and
03:03:54.399 by the 1990s they finally gave fruit
03:03:57.600 kevin Mitnik was arrested again nobody
03:04:00.319 doubted that he was the most powerful
03:04:01.920 hacker in the world and as such he
03:04:04.240 combined all the fears people
03:04:06.359 had other hackers could whistle to hack
03:04:08.880 through their phones so Mitnik could too
03:04:11.680 other hackers could break into military
03:04:13.439 bases so Mitnik could too other hackers
03:04:17.040 could launch nuclear weapons so Mitnik
03:04:19.760 could too and so when it came time for
03:04:22.640 Mitnik to serve his sentence the judge
03:04:24.800 was adamant the man poses a danger like
03:04:27.279 no other keeping him in solitary
03:04:29.120 confinement was the only way to prevent
03:04:30.720 the end of the world so into the hole he
03:04:33.760 went and the reason they had to keep me
03:04:35.359 away from the phone is I could pick up
03:04:36.800 the phone and I could whistle the launch
03:04:39.200 codes to start a nuclear war
03:04:42.760 so I I'm serious so I I actually laughed
03:04:46.479 in court so this is how two decades of
03:04:48.880 myths misconceptions and sensationalized
03:04:51.760 claims converges onto one man turning
03:04:54.160 his life upside down so I'm under such
03:04:56.880 stringent conditions of supervised
03:04:58.880 release that if I were to touch this
03:05:02.399 computer I would probably get sent back
03:05:05.680 to federal prison after serving his
03:05:07.520 sentence Mitnik used his fame to become
03:05:09.680 one of the best known names in cyber
03:05:11.520 security and devoted a lot of work to
03:05:13.840 breaking the same myths that made
03:05:15.600 several crucial years of his life into
03:05:17.920 such a miserable
03:05:23.479 experience
03:05:29.640 imagine one morning you wake up you get
03:05:33.040 out of bed and notice that something is
03:05:36.359 wrong your closet is now safe your
03:05:40.000 bathroom has a vault door on it and so
03:05:42.399 does your kitchen you've been locked out
03:05:44.640 of your life a message is plastered all
03:05:47.600 over the walls do you want to regain
03:05:49.439 access pay $3 million to a local
03:05:51.840 criminal gang oh and they've also been
03:05:54.080 secretly filming you for the last
03:05:55.359 several years so if you don't pay they
03:05:57.840 can release all that footage too every
03:06:00.800 day hundreds of people around the world
03:06:03.040 wake up to this reality only the locks
03:06:05.840 are not in the real world but in the
03:06:07.840 virtual one this is ransomware a
03:06:11.359 billiondoll extortion industry that
03:06:13.279 works on a simple premise pay or be
03:06:16.640 ruined
03:06:23.600 the basics behind ransomware attacks are
03:06:25.920 simple at first the criminals have to
03:06:28.160 get access to the victim's system this
03:06:30.080 can be done by fishing or bribing an
03:06:32.160 employee or as in the case of the
03:06:34.080 Colonial Pipeline attack in 2021 by just
03:06:37.120 finding a password in another leak then
03:06:40.319 the attackers plant a simple
03:06:42.000 self-replicating code that meticulously
03:06:44.399 encrypts whatever data it finds
03:06:47.439 the code hides in the background avoids
03:06:49.520 critical files and moves to other
03:06:52.399 computers in the network meanwhile it
03:06:55.120 chooses the juiciest files and beams
03:06:57.359 them straight to a hiding place on the
03:06:58.960 dark web just in case and obviously
03:07:01.920 leave a message that your data has been
03:07:04.319 blocked until you pay the ransom or if
03:07:07.520 you don't pay the ransom we won't give
03:07:09.600 you back the key and we'll publish the
03:07:12.160 data that we've exfiltrated
03:07:15.200 now the device is just an expensive
03:07:17.040 paper weight for ordinary people this is
03:07:19.520 ruinous for companies even more so
03:07:22.560 customers can't be served payments can't
03:07:24.800 be processed goods can't be purchased or
03:07:27.640 sold the victim has two choices it can
03:07:30.960 pay and maybe avoid the consequences or
03:07:33.920 it can try and fix the damage wipe its
03:07:36.160 systems clean and start from scratch or
03:07:38.399 use a backup if it has one but this
03:07:40.800 costs a lot of money and there's always
03:07:42.640 a chance of a repeated infection if you
03:07:45.200 pay you probably get those files back
03:07:48.560 but it's a fishy thing it's never 100%
03:07:51.520 also they can impose you a double ransom
03:07:54.160 they can ask for more money it's a harsh
03:07:56.880 business because you can't really take
03:07:58.960 your attackers into court for mom and
03:08:01.920 pop shops the bulk of ransomware victims
03:08:04.399 this often means bankruptcy attacks on
03:08:07.120 larger companies can lead to a disaster
03:08:09.200 for thousands
03:08:12.080 this is potentially the most substantial
03:08:13.920 and damaging attack on US critical
03:08:15.920 infrastructure ever
03:08:18.319 how a group of criminals was able to
03:08:21.359 infiltrate your networks steal nearly
03:08:24.080 100 gigabytes of data in just 2 hours
03:08:27.520 and then lock your systems with
03:08:29.200 ransomware to demand payment
03:08:33.200 the Colonial Pipeline story ended in a
03:08:35.520 massive crisis entire states were struck
03:08:38.319 and paralyzed due to a shortage of fuel
03:08:41.040 and the criminals didn't even attack the
03:08:43.040 pipeline's industrial equipment they
03:08:45.200 only locked down the payment processing
03:08:47.040 part of the business the rest of the
03:08:49.120 damage was done by the company itself
03:08:51.200 which was unable to function and decided
03:08:53.439 to shut down the criminals got what they
03:08:56.160 wanted though and Colonial never saw
03:08:58.319 them again but who are
03:09:01.720 they the Colonial Pipeline attack has
03:09:04.399 been perpetrated by Dark Side all things
03:09:06.720 considered a new gang at the time and a
03:09:09.200 short-lived one it conducted several
03:09:11.359 successful attacks extorted several
03:09:13.600 million dollars and disappeared within a
03:09:16.120 year compared to the major players on
03:09:18.560 the market Dark Side was just a blip on
03:09:20.640 the
03:09:21.640 radar at the time the market was
03:09:24.080 dominated by the likes of Ki Lockbit and
03:09:27.040 Reville all of them including Dark Side
03:09:30.240 united by one thing their location none
03:09:33.840 of these gangs are hiding the fact that
03:09:35.439 they operate from the postsviet space so
03:09:38.800 like Russia Kazakhstan Ukraine the
03:09:42.920 Baltics these countries mostly Russia
03:09:51.840 the leaders of these gangs are part of
03:09:53.680 the Russian criminal elite enjoying both
03:09:56.160 the protection of the government and the
03:09:58.080 freedom to relish in the
03:10:01.319 spoils however depicting them as just
03:10:04.160 Russian groups is not entirely correct
03:10:06.640 they are truly international
03:10:08.439 conglomerations with hundreds of
03:10:10.160 criminals from all across the world
03:10:12.000 operating in unison take Lockpit the
03:10:15.040 largest cyber criminal gang that has
03:10:16.880 ever existed
03:10:18.800 it has around 100 skilled developers and
03:10:21.040 customer support specialists who work on
03:10:23.040 the software and manage the operations
03:10:25.520 but they don't conduct the attacks this
03:10:27.760 task is delegated to the affiliates
03:10:30.640 thousands upon thousands of low-level
03:10:33.200 cyber criminals from around the world
03:10:36.000 such a model is known as ransomware as a
03:10:38.720 service it has been copied straight out
03:10:40.960 of the books of legitimate businesses
03:10:43.200 and it proved extremely versatile not
03:10:45.600 only is it profitable it allows the main
03:10:47.680 criminals to easily avoid capture
03:10:50.000 whenever one affiliate is caught by law
03:10:51.760 enforcement dozens spring up to take
03:10:53.840 their place
03:10:57.359 and the profits part can't be
03:11:01.160 overstated we'll never know for sure how
03:11:03.680 much money is being paid to the
03:11:05.040 ransomware
03:11:06.439 groups however some payments are public
03:11:12.319 for example Colonial Pipeline paid over
03:11:14.720 $2 million to resume
03:11:17.640 operations this pales in comparison to
03:11:20.080 the largest payout ever recorded $40
03:11:22.640 million paid by CNA Insurance Company in
03:11:27.479 2021 in 2022 the total revenue of
03:11:30.880 ransomware groups was estimated at
03:11:32.720 nearly half a billion some reports say
03:11:35.439 that ransomware operations will reach a
03:11:40.040 billion dollar market capitalization or
03:11:42.800 like revenue next year some reports say
03:11:46.319 that it has already been reached so we
03:11:48.960 can only assume and calculate the ones
03:11:51.279 that we know of and some reports say
03:11:54.240 that less than 60% of all of the
03:11:57.279 companies report ransomware attacks so I
03:12:00.479 would say that we've probably reached
03:12:03.920 that 1 billion
03:12:06.800 but this is just the number that the
03:12:08.479 cyber criminals
03:12:10.040 earn the damages they cause are orders
03:12:13.120 of magnitude
03:12:14.359 larger wiping the systems restoring the
03:12:17.359 data and ensuring that the attack can't
03:12:19.520 repeat all the while not earning a
03:12:21.840 single penny from their customers
03:12:24.319 it's estimated that in 2021 the total
03:12:26.880 damage caused by ransomware gangs
03:12:28.640 reached $20
03:12:29.960 billion and within a decade it will
03:12:32.560 probably grow
03:12:42.680 10fold the stories like those of CNA and
03:12:45.600 Colonial Pipeline make the news but most
03:12:48.080 of the ransomware victims don't the pool
03:12:50.640 of companies and people that can be
03:12:52.399 exploited is endless on one hand
03:12:55.840 attackers can cast a wide net and seek
03:12:57.920 to infect as many computers as they can
03:13:00.319 targeting individuals and their personal
03:13:02.160 data on the other hand they conduct
03:13:04.560 targeted attacks seeking out companies
03:13:06.720 that are more difficult to breach but
03:13:08.560 can bring much larger revenue companies
03:13:11.279 on every continent in every industry of
03:13:14.160 all sizes ransomware gangs don't shy
03:13:16.960 from attacking whatever they can
03:13:18.960 including hospitals shelters and charity
03:13:21.800 organizations if criminals ever had a
03:13:24.080 code of honor it's now long gone
03:13:27.200 ransomware operators especially the ones
03:13:29.439 based in Russia they know no fair they
03:13:32.000 don't give a damn like at all some of
03:13:34.800 them have Twitter accounts just you know
03:13:37.359 posting how they're cooking Shashlik
03:13:39.760 with names of ransomware gangs in their
03:13:42.960 Twitter handles
03:13:46.880 so how do we stop it is there an easy
03:13:49.359 way to get rid of this
03:13:50.840 problem no whoever promises you an easy
03:13:54.640 solution is probably lying or diluting
03:13:58.200 themselves however one thing that can be
03:14:00.800 done is spreading awareness the more
03:14:03.040 people know what ransomware is and how
03:14:04.800 it works the better the scale of this
03:14:07.520 criminal activity is often very
03:14:09.279 difficult to perceive which is why
03:14:11.120 Cyberne created a new tool called Ransom
03:14:13.680 Looker which you can find in the
03:14:15.279 description right now it's the largest
03:14:17.600 and most extensive visualization of
03:14:19.439 ransomware statistics in the world it
03:14:22.000 shows the size and the impact of the
03:14:23.600 whole industry with its largest players
03:14:25.680 victims and trends to create it our team
03:14:28.800 went to places that you would prefer not
03:14:30.880 knowing about
03:14:41.279 who is Anonymous Sudan just in recent
03:14:44.399 days they attacked Microsoft LinkedIn
03:14:46.880 UPS OpenAI governmental and military
03:14:49.680 establishments across Sweden Germany and
03:14:52.319 Israel and the entire European banking
03:14:55.200 system all of these giants overrun by a
03:14:58.399 group of scrappy tech enthusiasts from a
03:15:00.560 wartorrn country with a barely
03:15:02.319 functioning internet connection at least
03:15:04.880 that's if you believe their own story
03:15:07.279 and oh boy do they know how to spin it
03:15:10.080 but is there any truth to it are they
03:15:12.720 the anonymous we all know are they
03:15:15.120 really from Sudan and where does the
03:15:17.840 money for all these highlevel operations
03:15:20.160 come from anyways let's look into this
03:15:29.200 we all know Anonymous the infamous
03:15:31.840 international activist movement united
03:15:34.160 by its anti-establishment goals and a
03:15:36.800 love for that particular mask in the
03:15:39.439 early 2010s Anonymous played a part in
03:15:41.760 Arab Spring revolts branches of the
03:15:44.080 collective sprung up in countries across
03:15:46.479 North Africa and the Middle East sudan
03:15:48.800 had a branch too in the form of several
03:15:51.359 social media groups spreading the
03:15:53.200 philosophy of anonymous and calling for
03:15:55.439 political change but it never got
03:15:57.520 prominent except for that one time in
03:15:59.920 2019 when people calling themselves
03:16:02.479 anonymous organized several cyber
03:16:04.720 attacks on the Sudanese government or
03:16:07.040 rather they didn't get prominent until
03:16:09.600 2023 when suddenly a new anonymous Sudan
03:16:13.680 emerged in January somebody registered a
03:16:16.560 group on Telegram an app beloved by
03:16:18.960 dissident and criminals alike and
03:16:20.960 started attacking people with vigor
03:16:23.520 their first target was Sweden the entire
03:16:26.720 country of Sweden the Swedish government
03:16:29.520 banks companies universities and scores
03:16:32.160 of other web pages got hit as a sign of
03:16:34.479 protest what they originally tried to do
03:16:37.279 was rather specific they were trying to
03:16:39.880 capitalize on a Swedish right-wing
03:16:43.439 extremist called Rasmos Paladan who
03:16:46.359 probably you know incited by right
03:16:49.399 pro-Russians to burn a Kuran outside the
03:16:52.800 embassy of Turkey and that's pretty
03:16:55.359 obvious to us that is something they did
03:16:58.080 they try to amplify it they try to stir
03:17:01.040 up wedge issues between the Islamic
03:17:03.680 world and the Western world and
03:17:05.600 specifically Turkey however despite
03:17:08.319 being from Sudan and fighting against
03:17:10.960 the enemies of Islam Anonymous Sudan
03:17:13.840 communicated in quite a peculiar way
03:17:16.640 their posts were only in English and
03:17:19.040 Russian and they instantly got picked up
03:17:21.279 by prominent Russian activist groups
03:17:23.279 such as Kilnet who took it upon
03:17:25.279 themselves to promote this newcomer the
03:17:27.840 newcomer instantly responded by
03:17:30.560 endorsing the Russian government and
03:17:32.640 vowing to fight alongside it because it
03:17:35.600 is helping Sudan this may sound
03:17:38.200 implausible until you consider that in
03:17:40.720 the current Sudanese civil war Russia
03:17:43.600 actually arms and supports both sides of
03:17:46.160 the conflict so at least they're not
03:17:48.960 wrong but this is not how things tend to
03:17:51.600 work in the region there is a whole
03:17:53.600 ecosystem of Muslim activist groups some
03:17:56.319 of them progovernment and others
03:17:58.279 anti-government some of them more
03:18:00.080 radical and others less so all of them
03:18:02.880 interconnected in various complex ways
03:18:06.000 and anonymous Sudan just doesn't fit
03:18:09.359 into that picture and they fit even less
03:18:11.760 into the framework of Anonymous who not
03:18:14.399 only disavowed them but conducted
03:18:16.239 operations to strike down the
03:18:17.840 infrastructure anonymous Sudan uses when
03:18:20.560 Anonymous started from the beginnings
03:18:23.640 their moto or what guided them was
03:18:26.520 basically
03:18:28.040 anti-establishment movement and
03:18:30.239 anonymous Sudanese are clearly
03:18:32.319 affiliated with Russian government so we
03:18:36.000 can be pretty sure Anonymous Sudan has
03:18:38.640 nothing to do with anonymous what comes
03:18:41.359 next is pretty interesting
03:18:43.610 [Music]
03:18:45.920 so ever since being created in early
03:18:48.000 2023 Anonymous Sudan exclusively
03:18:50.720 attacked the countries that are at odds
03:18:52.640 with Russia and many people who analyze
03:18:55.040 their activities draw the line at this
03:18:57.359 but this does not prove they're from
03:18:59.600 Russia we need stronger evidence to
03:19:02.160 allege that do we have it well we do
03:19:06.160 these attacks were organized exclusively
03:19:08.399 in collaboration with Russian hacker
03:19:10.399 groups and they never even tried
03:19:12.560 interfering with Sudan's internal
03:19:14.319 affairs they were communicating in
03:19:16.399 Russian their social media page was
03:19:19.479 created in Russia if you look at the
03:19:22.640 Telegram records they were basically
03:19:25.040 mostly amplifying other Russian activist
03:19:28.399 groups the media was still sometimes
03:19:30.960 referring to them as a religious
03:19:32.720 activist group so the cover worked at
03:19:35.600 least until cyber security researchers
03:19:37.920 started looking into their activity and
03:19:40.000 then just saying you're from Sudan was
03:19:42.399 no longer enough and what happened since
03:19:45.000 then is that as we intrus and other
03:19:49.840 cyber security researchers pointed out
03:19:52.800 that hey they claim from Sudan but they
03:19:55.120 only communicate in Russian and so they
03:19:57.359 have changed their mo they started to go
03:19:59.600 back and delete their old post and
03:20:02.479 suddenly they find someone who can start
03:20:04.319 posting in Arabic and so on first they
03:20:06.880 had a guy who speak Arabic but it was a
03:20:08.720 pretty you know the kind of Arabic you
03:20:10.800 learn in school so and then we pointed
03:20:13.600 that out and then suddenly they found
03:20:16.239 someone who actually can speak Arabic
03:20:18.239 with a Sudanese dialect so it is quite
03:20:21.359 apparent that anonymous Sudan is neither
03:20:23.760 anonymous nor Sudanese but who precisely
03:20:27.439 are they to uncover that we have to look
03:20:29.840 into how the group
03:20:33.800 operates so the main method of attack
03:20:36.399 for anonymous Sudan are DDoS attacks or
03:20:39.520 distributed denial of service attacks
03:20:42.080 and they're quite easy to understand the
03:20:44.239 main idea is this whenever you want to
03:20:46.160 visit a web page your device sends a
03:20:48.160 request to a server where that web page
03:20:50.160 is stored and the server shows you the
03:20:52.399 web page but if there are too many
03:20:54.399 requests the server might get overloaded
03:20:57.040 which is an easy thing to exploit all a
03:20:59.439 hacker has to do is send a lot of
03:21:01.520 requests to a server huge amount of
03:21:03.840 requests you fill up the memory and
03:21:06.720 basically any new requests from
03:21:09.279 legitimate users are then blocked and
03:21:12.000 you don't see the website does that do
03:21:14.479 any actual damage to the server nope to
03:21:16.800 the website nope does that hit the
03:21:19.120 headlines yes because the website is
03:21:21.200 unreachable but large companies tend to
03:21:23.439 invest a lot into protection from DOS
03:21:25.840 attacks and can fend them off pretty
03:21:27.680 effectively so the latest generation of
03:21:30.160 hacker groups does something a bit more
03:21:32.359 sophisticated traditional DDoS attacks
03:21:35.840 mostly consists of botnet IoT devices
03:21:40.399 infected by bots like the Mai bot to
03:21:43.840 create these mass sin attacks so-called
03:21:47.040 volutric attacks or layer three layer
03:21:49.520 four attacks recently more and more the
03:21:52.880 most qualified DOS attacks are those
03:21:55.359 that comes from so-cal HTTP based attack
03:21:58.720 and that is someone rents a number of
03:22:03.040 VPSs's in some company that doesn't ask
03:22:06.319 too much and then use them to generate
03:22:08.800 lots of HTTP based traffic malformed
03:22:12.080 traffic that generates fewer calls but
03:22:15.760 because they are HTTP based they can
03:22:18.359 actually jam even better than the
03:22:21.120 volutric because they're harder to
03:22:22.960 filter out while such attacks are
03:22:25.439 scarier and can bring down a web page
03:22:27.600 for longer it is often possible to
03:22:29.760 single out where the attack came from at
03:22:32.080 least if the IP addresses have been tied
03:22:34.239 to a particular company that supplied
03:22:36.319 them and in the case of Anonymous Sudan
03:22:39.040 yeah they were buying their traffic from
03:22:40.880 some high-end suppliers in Germany and
03:22:43.279 paying them some serious cash these same
03:22:46.239 servers were routinely used by other
03:22:48.560 Russian hacker groups such as Kilnet and
03:22:50.840 Noame and yes they were the same ones
03:22:53.600 the real Anonymous attacked in their
03:22:55.760 counterattack against the impostors
03:22:58.319 since then the group moved on to other
03:23:00.600 services and from the fact that it
03:23:02.960 increased its volume of attacks
03:23:05.000 significantly we can assume that its
03:23:07.520 spending also had to increase a lot so
03:23:10.720 yeah they're not the scrubby guys with
03:23:12.800 slow internet connection that's for sure
03:23:15.760 but where do they get their income
03:23:18.640 that's a bit less clear the experts we
03:23:21.279 talked to can only guess some say
03:23:23.680 Anonymous Sudan may be financed directly
03:23:26.399 by the Russian government or by some
03:23:28.800 oligarch or as a proxy of some other
03:23:31.359 money-making activist venture like
03:23:33.200 Kilnet by the way you may have heard
03:23:35.359 that a few weeks ago Anonymous Sudan
03:23:38.000 Kilnet and Revel created the so-called
03:23:41.200 Darknet Parliament a sort of alliance to
03:23:44.399 coordinate their attacks since Revel was
03:23:47.200 dissolved a couple of years back and now
03:23:49.279 is only a sock puppet for Kilnet it
03:23:52.080 sounds very plausible that anonymous
03:23:54.239 Sudan works in the same way too i think
03:23:56.960 this is a lot to do with Kilnet and the
03:23:59.920 leader Kilnet Kill Me he's known for
03:24:02.479 trying to monetize everything he has the
03:24:05.040 Kilnet crypto exchange they're selling
03:24:07.439 Killnet jewelry online like he's good at
03:24:10.960 hype basically and I think this is a way
03:24:14.319 use the the R evil name is now available
03:24:18.160 because R Evil is doesn't exist anymore
03:24:20.720 so but it still you know resonates in
03:24:24.080 some easily fooled group so he can use
03:24:26.960 it to make it sound as if they're doing
03:24:29.840 much worse things than they're doing a
03:24:31.840 lot of hacker groups who organized these
03:24:33.760 mass DDoS attacks have their
03:24:35.600 crowdfunding efforts sponsors or some
03:24:37.920 other way to generate cash and buy those
03:24:40.160 expensive servers so the attacks turn
03:24:42.560 into this vicious circle of promising
03:24:44.560 incredible results like taking down an
03:24:46.720 evil bank or a tech giant or a
03:24:48.800 government finding an audience that
03:24:50.640 wants to see the world burn squeezing
03:24:52.960 some funds from that audience and doing
03:24:55.359 that again with grander and grander
03:24:57.439 goals in mind now if Anonymous Sudan is
03:25:00.319 really just another money-making venture
03:25:02.160 of Killnet at least Kill Net's backers
03:25:04.720 see the results that are worth their
03:25:06.560 money right right okay they don't the
03:25:10.399 way Anonymous Sudan and similar gangs
03:25:12.640 describe their attacks mostly does not
03:25:14.720 reflect reality they constantly talk of
03:25:17.279 destroying Microsoft or European
03:25:19.279 Investment Bank or some other target but
03:25:21.680 all they actually do is overload their
03:25:23.840 websites with DDoS for several hours and
03:25:26.560 that's it like for example right now
03:25:29.040 they claims to have hacked and closed
03:25:31.840 the European bank transfer system they
03:25:35.359 downed the website with the
03:25:37.200 international bank that's not the same
03:25:40.399 so they love to hype this up and this is
03:25:43.680 part of their their MMO this is typical
03:25:47.120 Kilnet MMO like they do I think was the
03:25:51.359 the website for the Copenhagen airport
03:25:54.880 and then they put a picture on the
03:25:56.640 Telegram channel showing a burning plane
03:25:59.200 as if somehow airport exploded because
03:26:01.600 of this cyber attack so it's a lot of
03:26:05.160 hype that's all i think it's like it's
03:26:09.439 part of propaganda you know not a lot of
03:26:12.319 people know what when media writes that
03:26:14.880 there's been a cyber attack you know a
03:26:16.880 cyber attack is a cyber attack and an
03:26:18.640 attack is an attack it doesn't do actual
03:26:21.680 actual actual damage it's just
03:26:36.439 cloud for several years Lockbit Bit was
03:26:39.600 the largest and most powerful cyber gang
03:26:42.319 in the world it attacked thousands of
03:26:45.439 people breaking into their computers
03:26:47.600 encrypting their data and demanding
03:26:49.840 ransom and the gang wasn't even doing
03:26:52.399 that itself it automated and outsourced
03:26:55.200 the process revolutionizing the market
03:26:57.120 and leaving rival gangs in the dust but
03:27:00.239 then something went wrong and not
03:27:02.960 because the gang was unsuccessful it's
03:27:05.600 because it had too much success so
03:27:09.040 here's the story of Lockbit a criminal
03:27:12.200 organization like no other
03:27:18.160 around 2 years ago a man went undercover
03:27:20.880 and infiltrated Lockpit he became the
03:27:24.000 only person to witness its secrets from
03:27:26.080 inside and report them that man is John
03:27:30.319 Deaggio i got to know them over time and
03:27:33.840 use fake personas and accounts we've had
03:27:36.160 everything from you know water cooler
03:27:37.680 talk to you know stuff about their
03:27:39.760 operation i've actually had affiliates
03:27:41.680 tell me about attacks before they happen
03:27:44.160 the attacks John talks about are called
03:27:46.399 ransomware attacks they are lockbits
03:27:49.520 specialty the gang infects their
03:27:51.760 victim's computers with malware that
03:27:53.680 encrypts all the data turning the device
03:27:56.120 useless and then the gang demands ransom
03:27:59.680 basically it's like infecting someone
03:28:01.279 with an illness and selling the cure
03:28:03.439 many gangs did that before but from the
03:28:05.600 beginning Lockbit Bit had an edge it
03:28:08.080 wasn't just a collection of petty
03:28:09.920 criminals it's run like a business not a
03:28:12.479 criminal operation for the most part and
03:28:14.319 I think that's why they've had success
03:28:15.600 with withdrawing in other criminals is
03:28:17.439 because you know they always want to
03:28:18.880 talk about hey what do you want to see
03:28:20.080 next what services can we provide
03:28:21.840 lockbit copied business strategies of
03:28:24.239 legitimate companies for example they
03:28:26.640 announced a bug bounty program which
03:28:29.040 promised a reward for finding weaknesses
03:28:31.359 in their software just like a real
03:28:33.520 company would at the same time Lockbit
03:28:36.080 did not shy from copying other cyber
03:28:38.399 gangs that's how it adapted a model
03:28:40.880 called ransomware as a service instead
03:28:43.760 of attacking the victims themselves the
03:28:45.760 gang's members would lease the malicious
03:28:47.760 software to affiliates other cyber
03:28:50.239 criminals with less skills but more time
03:28:52.720 to spare and even here Lobit would
03:28:55.439 innovate prior to lockbit all the
03:28:57.760 ransomware gangs the way that the Raz
03:28:59.680 the ransomware as a service model worked
03:29:01.439 is the the ransomware provider the gang
03:29:04.399 who who controlled the financial aspect
03:29:06.640 of it and then they would pay the
03:29:08.640 affiliate and you were finding the core
03:29:10.479 gang started ripping off their partners
03:29:12.479 and so you had all these hackers that
03:29:13.920 weren't getting paid so what Lockbit did
03:29:15.439 was said was you go take the money you
03:29:17.760 just pay me my 20% lockbit treated their
03:29:20.880 affiliates as clients and their hacking
03:29:23.279 tool as a product the better and easier
03:29:26.880 a product is to use the more clients you
03:29:29.600 have the more clients you have the
03:29:32.399 higher is your revenue and it worked
03:29:35.760 wonders for them and that's because the
03:29:38.560 leader of lockbit is not going to be
03:29:40.560 known for being a hacker the leader of
03:29:42.160 lockpit is going to be known for being a
03:29:44.000 strong businessman and that is un like I
03:29:47.040 said it's unfortunate but that that is
03:29:48.800 the recipe that brought them success
03:29:51.200 over the years they've polished and
03:29:53.120 perfected their product adding more and
03:29:55.520 more features by 2022 when the third
03:29:58.800 version came along the functionality was
03:30:01.680 off the charts would you like your
03:30:04.319 malware to self-destruct after a certain
03:30:06.800 time infect other discs change the
03:30:09.840 victim's wallpaper there are options for
03:30:12.640 that on top of all now it does not only
03:30:15.760 encrypt but also steals the victim's
03:30:18.880 data publishing it on the dark web for
03:30:21.760 additional ransom they took what used to
03:30:24.080 take an average of around 3 weeks to a
03:30:26.640 month to completely breach expose uh get
03:30:29.840 administrative rights steal data and
03:30:32.000 encrypt data that they can now do in
03:30:34.560 days it was something I literally could
03:30:37.200 teach my kids to do for a while Lockbit
03:30:40.319 Bit were flying high they became the
03:30:42.800 largest and most powerful malware gang
03:30:45.200 out there surpassing any competitor by a
03:30:48.160 wide margin but then cracks began
03:30:51.200 showing
03:30:52.760 up remember the bug bounty program
03:30:55.760 Lockbit Bit implemented well the 3.0 had
03:30:59.279 a major bug the developer who created
03:31:01.840 Lockbit 3.0 he was the same developer
03:31:05.200 that was behind Dark Side who did the
03:31:07.680 Colonial Pipeline hack and Black Matter
03:31:10.239 ransomware so he used a lot of the
03:31:12.160 source code he'd already developed to
03:31:13.760 create this because of that there also
03:31:16.160 carried over a vulnerability in that was
03:31:18.960 found in Black Matter and somebody
03:31:20.560 figured that out loit had to pay
03:31:22.640 somebody $50,000 while that was peanuts
03:31:25.840 compared to the income the gang pulled
03:31:27.760 the leadership was upset and demanded
03:31:30.479 the developer to cover the bounty and
03:31:33.439 the developer was not having any of that
03:31:36.239 well he was upset at the developer and
03:31:39.040 he basically said "Hey I'm taking this
03:31:41.279 out of your revenue." The developer was
03:31:43.040 upset and said "Hey I you know brought
03:31:45.040 over this code and I didn't you know
03:31:47.200 that was time I would have had to charge
03:31:48.640 you to have developed it from scratch."
03:31:50.560 So the developer just left and despite
03:31:53.040 the gang he also leaked the source code
03:31:55.840 of the entire ransomware builder now
03:31:58.960 everybody could find it modify it and
03:32:01.359 use it without paying Lockbit its 20%
03:32:04.160 copycats started popping up and attacks
03:32:07.319 skyrocketed lockbit still had plenty of
03:32:10.080 affiliates though in fact the number of
03:32:12.319 people who wanted to use the genuine
03:32:14.479 software was a lot larger than Lockbit
03:32:17.160 anticipated and that brought problems we
03:32:20.160 have all encountered in our lives i kept
03:32:22.720 noticing that when I would go look and I
03:32:25.200 would actually I would go download the
03:32:26.880 data cuz part of my job is to validate
03:32:28.880 whether this is a real or threat or if
03:32:30.960 this is something that's being made up
03:32:32.319 or if it's fictitious data and I kept
03:32:34.479 having problems and at first I thought
03:32:35.920 it was me you know as I got more I'll
03:32:38.239 say smarter people in the engineering
03:32:40.000 side involved you know it became clear
03:32:42.160 that this was not just me it was a much
03:32:44.960 bigger problem and again it's just the
03:32:47.600 amount of data that has to be stored and
03:32:49.680 how quickly it's coming in and it's just
03:32:52.399 moving it from point A to point B when
03:32:54.239 you're talking about massive amounts of
03:32:56.560 data it's just not easy in the dark web
03:32:59.120 there's so much latency in those
03:33:00.720 connections as well let alone just the
03:33:02.720 space for the storage and remember
03:33:04.479 everything's automated so affiliate
03:33:06.080 hackers are just clicking the tab to
03:33:08.000 steal the data picking their variables
03:33:10.000 and it's doing it so when something
03:33:11.600 doesn't go right it just doesn't work so
03:33:14.399 one of the key features of the
03:33:15.840 ransomware software was no longer
03:33:17.920 working no developers supported the
03:33:20.080 updates of the software and the source
03:33:22.160 code for the free version was in the
03:33:24.080 wild with all of that the affiliates
03:33:26.319 started leaving at least several of the
03:33:28.880 prominent ones did so in a very public
03:33:31.120 manner choosing rival gangs that alone
03:33:34.720 wasn't enough to put Lock Bit down
03:33:36.800 though the numbers were falling but the
03:33:38.800 empire was still strong that is until
03:33:41.680 one of its rivals CL0P or KOP did the
03:33:46.120 unthinkable with this one hack Klopp
03:33:48.880 left Lockbit Bit in the dust surpassing
03:33:51.520 its victim count almost twofold earning
03:33:54.080 millions and pulling one of the largest
03:33:55.920 cyber attacks in recent
03:33:57.960 decades and that's the state of Lockbit
03:34:00.479 Bit today competition betrayal leaks and
03:34:04.160 storage problems taken separately those
03:34:07.040 troubles weren't too serious but
03:34:09.040 combined they brought the gang to the
03:34:10.960 brink and I see all these problems he's
03:34:13.040 having at the same time at the end of
03:34:14.800 the day these are all engineering
03:34:16.720 problems if he it's plausible he could
03:34:19.040 fix it and if he does they could get
03:34:21.040 right back on top so is this the
03:34:23.279 downfall of Lock Bit or will it manage
03:34:25.760 to shrug off the difficulties that's the
03:34:27.920 question we will likely see answered in
03:34:29.920 the coming year check out our channel
03:34:31.600 for short documentaries about other
03:34:33.439 cyber gangs and if you'd like to learn
